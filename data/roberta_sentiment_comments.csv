Sounds horrible to say but it is simply a fact. Why does life have to feed on life? Why do birds steal chicks from nests and eat them, it is unfair from our point of view because we understand suffering but it is just the way of it.

Flowing with Tao is understanding that this is life, this is the Tao moving in ways we find unacceptable but perhaps it's our understanding that is deluded?"

Philosophical Exploration,Understanding Taoism Through Textual Interpretation,NEUTRAL,0.5428973436355591,"As a leftist I learned that Taoism is good for personal and mental health but impractical when it comes to social action. A lot of Taoists have a somewhat ‘selfish’ view of existence that they use to justify pain and suffering. I think it’s important to realize a lot of philosophies like Taoism are about coping with existence and reality, which is fine, but for more politically minded people that mindset is simply outdated when it comes to things like homelessness. Why cope with a broken system when you can change it? Of course Taoism is still useful for existing in and managing your existence within the confines of what is."
,,,,"The question is, how do you know he's suffering? What makes his suffering fundamentally different than your's? Are you sure you're not just projecting a feeling you think you'd feel if you were in his shoes, to him?

Everyone has a difficult and easy life. We all make the choices that seem the most beneficial to us. You may be right that he's not doing well - but compared to what? Compared to what he \*could've\* been, perhaps he's doing his best. Most likely, that is true.

Perhaps his mental state, his intoxication, his physical state -things that you find unbearable, unthinkable- are this man's eden, his salvation, his release? Sensations that would shock and appall you are the life source of his being, carrying him forward day-to-day?

How do you judge his peace? Even if he's screaming, trashing, looking livid - why are those things \*innately\* bad?

Do you have no hardships in life? Do you view the same hardships and the tools you deal with them in the same vein? He also has hardships in his life, and he has his own tools. Tools that would not make sense to you. Tools that perhaps, ultimately, that could've been better. Were you never an infant? Did you never learn anything at all, in life? Everyone learns something along the way, everyone makes mistakes. We iterate, recalibrate, and carry on.

The man is just is. But he reflects highly your own emotional stance and assumptions. It's a delightful excuse to reflect our preconcieved notions. Why do you assume to judge for him? Did he ask for your help?

DDJ's Chapter 20 ""Being Different"" from Ursula LeGuin is amazing for this situation, I feel:

""How much difference between yes and no? What difference between good and bad? What the people fear must be feared. O desolation! Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit! Everybody’s cheerful, cheerful as if at a party, or climbing a tower in springtime. And here I sit unmoved, clueless, like a child, a baby too young to smile. Forlorn, forlorn. Like a homeless person. Most people have plenty. I’m the one that’s poor, a fool right through. Ignorant, ignorant. Most people are so bright. I’m the one that’s dull. Most people are so keen.

Addiction and mental health are major issues affecting every family these days. Sometimes it’s too hard for people to pull themselves out of the death spiral. They get stuck in lala land or can’t get by without their addiction. None of this is in accordance with the dao.

,,NEGATIVE,0.5234876871109009,"Two answers. 

Years ago an elderly woman hired me to fix a few things in her home. We got to talking and she asked me about Daoism, specifically how it responded to the Holocaust (I think she was Jewish). My response, immediate, from the gut, was ""about as well as any other religion--I'm not sure any of them have a good answer"". She seemed to find that a good response.

The other thing to remember is that homeless guy didn't just pop into existence because of some sort of Cosmic event. Homelessness is bye-and-large a result of specific policies taken by our government. In my home town, for example, I can remember the day when all the beggars suddenly showed up in the downtown. That was because the Conservative provincial govt cut welfare and disability payments by 20% for everyone. That meant people who were just getting by on their disability pensions or welfare cheques, all suffered a catastrophic loss of income.

Now we have an explosion of homelessness because the federal govt stopped building social housing in the 1990s, the provincial govt refused to force municipalities to let cities build enough housing, municipalities zoned most of the land in cities so the only thing you can build on it is single-detached homes that require a car to live in, and most homeowners fight tooth and nail against any new apartments or rent-geared-to-income in their neighbourhoods. 

Learning how the city operates and the real cause of beggars and homelessness is learning the Dao of the city. If you are upset about the individual, then get involved in trying to deal with these problems. The doing without doing comes down to understanding where the problem originates and learning the most efficient way of fixing it. Daoism offers you a toolbox that you can use to understand, navigate, and work in the world we inhabit. But that's where the 'kung fu' and 'eating bitter' part of Daoism come into play. And you aren't going to hear about them from people like Hoff or Mitchell--but they are absolutely key to the enterprise."

Community Relationships,Navigating Suffering and Learning,NEUTRAL,0.48689642548561096,"I think my biggest struggle when learning about the Tao (and I still have much to learn so my understanding may be wrong) however, from the understanding I have. The only thing that didn’t sit well with me was the concept of not interfering with what exists or is happening. 

The example I recall was about a tree in a stream. The tree branches don’t move for the water, but the water still finds a way to flow. 

Which is lovely in theory. 

In reality I find that much harder. I think the real question here would be, how can we watch suffering and offer no help? I understand that the teachings of the Tao are that we don’t interfere. It’s just that I believe there are times we should offer our help. 

So for me I suppose, the answer to your question would be that, the man you saw is having his own experience and right now part of his experience is the struggle he is facing with addiction and poor mental health. It’s not fair, but there is value in all lessons for those of us who are fortunate to find them. The deeper question for me would be, how can I walk past that man and not offer him help? Or not call someone else who may be able to help him? 

I’m open to hearing other perspectives on this. Because I’d like a broader understanding of this too.

,,NEUTRAL,0.5379867553710938,"In my view, living things exist within boundaries.  Temperature, oxygenation, food, safety, etc.  When those boundaries are violated suffering occurs.  Humans because we have consciousness have an expanded capacity for suffering because we have needs that other animals do not.  When you encounter suffering you can decide that you can alleviate it without crossing the boundaries of your own needs.  Having simple humble needs expands your capacity for compassion because your boundaries are easy to maintain.  By reducing the amount of suffering you are helping those who might encounter the suffering because a decent person feels distress when they observe terrible suffering.  Give thanks that you feel distress at his suffering.  If you did not you would be the kind of person who is indifferent or incapable of caring for a stranger.  People can be arranged into progressing categories.  Strangers, acquaintances, friends and family.  At each level there is a different obligation to attend to suffering.

Calm and unperturbed, the parent responds with care, meeting the baby’s needs without sharing in its distress. Parents learn what cries mean, and how to best respond.   Its not that the parent thinks  - no big deal, the baby is over-reacting.  It is quite the opposite, the parent knows to now turn their energy and resources towards the baby to help out. 

The man’s that  you saw in the street, his suffering is not a flaw or failure but a natural part of universe’s unfolding.  A message for the other caregivers to respond to.

I am a HS teacher, and a lot of the suffering I see in my students are like baby cries.  “I can’t believe they told my secret”, “It is not fair that she got to… and I did not”, etc. etc.  And again it’s not that I think – “no big deal” – I wonder what I can do to help.

That being said, sometimes I can’t do much, other times I can do a lot.  This is the point that Taoism helps me.  (Zhuangzi’s “Fasting of the mind”)  When I calm my mind, become mindful and aware, usually it comes to me what my Path forward is….

Why do I say that? He could find a therapist, learn mindfulness, read about and practice Taoism, learn Tai Chi or Chi Kung. Any of these things can help him to stop using drugs and find inner peace.

Why do I say that? You say he is in mental crisis possibly on drugs - if he's taken drugs then he's trying to sooth his mental pain. Where did this mental pain come from? We won't know but he may do - or he may have forgotten. It could be child abuse, bullying, losing everything he once owned (and ending up on the street - failure, loss of control etc), maybe he's a war veteran dealing with PTSD.

Philosophical Exploration,Taoism and Environmental Ethics,,,"I struggle with this as well. 

The best I've been able to come to terms with suffering is that the ten thousand things exist because they all exist. To deny any one of them is to deny existence, and of the infinite dimensions, not existing is more likely than existing. There is a smaller finite set of infinite universes in which the laws of physics exist in such a way they allow for matter and energy to interact in space time as we observe them. Most of the variations are a null set. 

So if suffering exists, it has to occupy some part of the universe. You directly experience it, or you observe someone else experiencing it. They are your loved one, or a stranger, or an enemy. There are levels of distance from suffering and levels of intensity. Do we have a choice in whether or not we encounter suffering or experience it in some of its aspects? 

I think that if existence is truly infinite and limitless, then at some point we have been everyone and experienced every permutation. Like everything else you encounter, suffering leaves an impression on you, it shapes you, sometimes it spurs you to action. 

The what of that can go every which way. It might move you to do works to lessen the suffering of others. Or to help this man specifically. Maybe you give him a dollar. Maybe you take him into your home and get him the best help you can. Maybe he blossoms under this care and later when you are in need he returns the favor, or pays it forward to someone else. Or maybe he takes advantage, robs you, or beats you. Kills your pet. Maybe you just ruminate on the implications of knowing there is suffering that you are not preventing. You could seek a life of comfort and strive to avoid suffering. Or any number of possibilities. 

Who you are shapes how you engage suffering, and encountering suffering changes your shape. Maybe you have the ability to exert your will on the outcome of the impact, or maybe you just observe it passively. 

Trying to accept the existence of suffering has at times driven me out of my mind. So you ask yourself, if you were the emperor of all existence and could eliminate suffering, where would you draw the lines? That has the potential to lead to some very dark thoughts. Eventually, you end up erasing all of existence. 

There is no static state, though. Suffering is as temporary as everything else. Become acquainted with it but don't let it consume you

I think you’re right, that there are different times where different behaviours are more appropriate. I think in relation to what you shared about when the appropriate time to help someone might be, the thing I understood most was 

‘is their problem self-imposed to such an extent that my interference would mean nothing’ 

For me, it makes the most sense not to help in this situation because sharing the burden of suffering if my help has no impact, doesn’t seem helpful to anyone. 

I do struggle more so with the idea of 

‘Will attempting to help someone throw my whole life into chaos…’

That’s most definitely a ‘me’ issue. I do help others sometimes at my own expense, and I suppose for me I often reason that with the fact that they are better off, even if I’m not. I think it comes from a place of being taught that my needs, wants or desires don’t supersede that of anyone else’s. So how do I knowingly ignore someone else’s need for help? Even if it comes at my expense, If that makes sense. 

That’s obviously a much different tangent to the question OP is asking, and is a much more personal journey of understanding for myself. I suppose I’m just learning, and part of my journey is having to figure out when it is and isn’t okay to let myself get hurt, if it benefits someone else. If that makes sense? Not in the context of someone else intentionally hurting me, of course. Just, in general life. If I can help, I do. Perhaps I shouldn’t always."

My own answer as a Taoist whose deeply influenced by Arthur Schopenhaur's view of the world as well as the Buddha's, is that the man you saw is in the state he's in because his suffering aligns with someone else's fundamental self-interest and possibly the overall way of things, metaphysically speaking. For one, he exists. He was birthed into the world. He has a mother and a father. 

Secondly he was born into a very particular world. A world in which it is easier to fall apart than it is to continue one's whole life in a state of ""positive wholeness"". Suppose I have severe back pains so I take legal medication for it. This can easily lead down a path of dependency. Pain is inevitable and paths of dependency are manufactured in abundance.

I think perhaps I struggle with the concept of ‘This isn’t my responsibility, so I won’t help’ because it was something I heard a lot by people who could have stopped my childhood abuse, but didn’t. So now I feel internal pushback when people turn the other cheek instead of helping others. 

Equally, I will often sacrifice my own peace, in order to help someone else even if it hurts me. Which I suppose comes from putting other people’s needs above my own, as that often went hand in hand with my experiences too. 

I think I also want to always help, because I know how hard it is to need help and not have it. Which is something I don’t ever want anyone else to feel or experience. 

I like your perspective of revisiting and reevaluating our relationships with our own suffering and the suffering of others.

,,,,"I do, the way you said “there is no why” is just such a Chinese way of putting it. It delighted me. 😂 

I don’t know if I have ever heard someone who doesn’t speak Chinese say it. And normally they say it in Chinese. I only hear it aloud in English so much cause my partner and I say it aloud to each other all the time in English cause it is funnier in a English for some reason and English is our native language. 

But as you have Chinese family maybe you were exposed from them. So my theory still stands. 

I have Chinese family too and that is absolutely where we got it from. I don’t know if non-family will ever get exasperated enough with you to just be like “there is no why!!!!” 🤣 But Chinese family will say it to you all the time. You ask them why this or that and when they can’t come up with a reason they tell you there is no why. 

It’s funny though cause it has this sort of short circuit effect on my brain in a way that “just because” as an answer doesn’t, even though they are essentially the same thing.

They are both sort of nonsense answers in their own ways… but for me putting focus on the question makes me think I am asking the wrong question or my perspective is off. The question itself is not one worth asking because I am not seeing the situation clearly. Where as the focus on the answer with “just because” feels oddly disheartening and without recourse to understand further.

The focus on the question itself is more effective for me as it redirects me to seek a different perspective and find a new question to ask. So when someone says “there is no why” I can move on to seeking other questions to ask without dwelling on the fact I came up with no answers for that question. Some puzzles/problems/equations are unsolvable. The question is a like a puzzle you are trying to solve about some aspect of reality and sometimes you are stuck on an unsolvable puzzle. So just move on. Focus on a solvable one for now. 

Learning new languages is fun and it can change how you think. I didn’t have as many weird moments like that with Spanish though.. it is more closely related to English so it was more familiar in a way. Makes me want to try Catalan or some other language isolate."

Fear is commonly overcome with experience. 

We fear the unknown. When events occur that we are unfamiliar with, and we don't know what to do, we experience fear.

When the unknown becomes known, which occurs overtime with experience, fear eventually dissipates on its own.

,,NEUTRAL,0.4614061415195465,"Hello, welcome. First, I don't claim to know anything. You're welcome to take to heart anything that seems to make sense and ignore what doesn't.


To me it seems that there are at least two separate questions here. 

The easy one is whether having hobbies like art and music are in keeping with the notion of effortless action. You might not remember it, but learning to walk did not come effortlessly to any of us. It is a struggle and requires trying over and over again, often falling on your butt, before you catch the logic to it. But once you do, it becomes effortless. Every time you stand up, you don't put any thought into how to keep your balance. Not anymore and not for a long time. 

That is flowing with the tao. 

The harder one is whether our way of living is in accord with the tao. I would say our way of living flows with the tao about the way that beaver dams flow with a river. Ever since we created agriculture and then built cities, stopped following game animals and moving with the change of seasons, we have in a way been resisting that natural and instinctual aspect of our animal bodies, of our evolutionary path that led us to develop complex brains that we use to overthink everything, for good and for ill. 

Is it natural for a domesticated animal to be kept as a pet? 

We are a composite of many different aspects, some of which contradicts each other, some of which are paradoxical. So we are never fully at rest, completely balanced, because our pieces don't all fit in the same puzzle. No matter how you try to seek out a perfect harmony, something will be off kilter. 

You might decide that for you, the tao means abandoning society and returning to a primitive state of living in the natural wilds. You'll find that to require a great deal of struggle.

 You might decide that the development of human intellect and modern societies make it necessary for you to acquire certain things, which require you to put great time and effort into things that you do not care about or feel any connection with, like studying geometry or getting an unfulfilling job. 

It takes a lot of work to find the flow of life that feels effortless to you, and once you find it, it is easy to lose again. 

It is a lot like surfing."

Philosophical Exploration,Taoism and Environmental Ethics,NEUTRAL,0.46506592631340027,"I have dissociation problems too. Daoism doesn't really change it, but it helps with the confusion on the more philosophical side. For instance, sometimes derealisation ends but you still wonder if it might actually be true - and it does seem like if you can cement your view that it's true, the episodes will happen less or pass quicker. For me it's interesting to think about parts of my life that are in line with the dao and parts that aren't - and derealisation seems to occur more when I'm doing parts that aren't in line.

That is, if I'm looking after my family or doing my passionate work, then I never get derealisation. These things are in line with the dao. Maybe derealisation is simply an over reaction to being against the dao? Outside of daoism, this makes a bit of sense - sitting on social media for literal hours of caveman brain hunting and fornicating time, is basically choosing to leave reality for a few hours. There's no analogy your instincts can draw between what they feel the world is like and what you are currently seeing - except maybe porn addiction. In this really basic reading of the dao, a lot of what we do really is going against our human nature, so it's no surprise we get negative mental health issues as a result.

But depersonalisation, yeah I dunno. I get that too and I have tried everything. I am at the point where I recognise it as what it is and try to just ride it out - like recognising you're having a nightmare part way through. It helps, but doesn't stop it.

I will say, through treatment and meditation, I traded a lot of the debilitating side of depression and anxiety for a raise in dissociation. Dissociation sounds far more dramatic, but it's a trade I would make again for the most part. I don't have alters though - I guess if I started having alters then the trade would be a lot more complicated."

,,,,"I've been pondering your question and it just seems weird to me. But maybe that's just because I've already gone through something like this (not my significant other---whom I've always loved completely) and gotten out the other side of it.  

First, there's the question of using the language 'romantic partner'. I find it bizarre that you'd use this term for someone you've been married to for 12 years. ""Romance""? That sounds like eros to me, which I find hard to believe anyone expects to last more than a few years at most. What you want is a partner who is a deep friend and whom you work with to find a place in the world. You don't mention if you have children, but as a man I just expect that the person a woman really loves isn't her man--it's her child. 

Second, there's the whole question of 'not finding her attractive'. It seems kinda childish for a grown man at your age to be thinking about physical attraction. I'm always amazed when people talk about physical attraction in terms of love and relationships. It just seems so shallow. Love and lust are totally different and should never be associated with each other.

Please don't take this as an attack. Perhaps there's some other reason for your dissatisfaction beyond the 'not finding her attractive' thing. I can certainly get that it might be irritating that she wants to spend so much time on her family. Is there something else that you can't articulate well so you are falling into old cliches? (I think this happens a lot. Sorta like the story of a guy searching for his lost keys under a streetlight 'because the lights better there'.)

As for the 'Daoist thing', I'd just say that part of the Dao of relationships is something popularly called 'the seven year itch' or men having a 'mid-life crisis'. That's when someone gets to a point in life where they can't fool themselves anymore that whatever they are doing is just a temporary stepping-stone to something else that they really want. The desire to reach out for that brass ring before they lose any possibility of getting it can be really strong. Sometimes it is the right thing to reach out and move on. Sometimes, however, it is a total disaster and people spend the rest of their lives unhappy because they threw away something very worthwhile for a poorly-thought-out, ridiculous fantasy.

Whenever I get annoyed with my significant other (which doesn't happen very often) I remember that Liezi became a realized man not after studying to masters or weird shamans. Instead, realization came after he gave all that stuff up and decided to devote himself to helping his wife with the work in the house and on the farm."

Practical Taoism,Balancing Desire and Contentment,NEUTRAL,0.6054768562316895,"There is no absolute right or wrong decision. 

There are only causes and their effects/consequences. 

Some consequences may be predicted as likely from their causes, however there are always unanticipated consequences.

In the end, the attitudes and beliefs we use to interpret/measure our decisions and their consequences determine the comfort, or discomfort, that results from the decision we've made. 

In general, we tend to justify in our own mind what we choose to do anyway. 

Perhaps what is being looked for within the OP is support, validation, justification, and/or approval for a decision already made.

While happiness is determined by our inner condition of being regardless of external circumstances, we often use our reactions to external circumstances to determine our happiness, level of contentment. 

So, if the question is can one be happy/content while in such a relationship? The answer is yes. When we don't rely upon the relationship for our contentment. 

If we still rely upon external circumstances, a relationship in this situation, to provide our contentment, then it is unlikely contentment will result, since we have already measured the relationship as lacking the necessary ingredients for obtaining our contentment. 

Anyway we slice it, it is our own inner condition of mind that will determine our long term contentment, even if we use our external relationships as a proxy for determining the contentment we allow ourselves to obtain."

I don't think the DDJ has any specific advice about this. But this is how I've been thinking about it. 

If you want to stay, you could do more to take care of your own needs. We make ourselves happy, not our partners (or anyone else). For instance when she has family get togethers, if you hate them, go do something else. Also, although we don't find our partners particularly attractive, they have other qualities we were/are attracted to. Can you focus more on those and do they make up for the lesser attractiveness? It tends to be human nature to focus on negatives and sometimes we forget about the whole truth with all the positives too.

If you choose to break up, it's certainly possible to remain friends. I know a couple who are still good friends with an ex and their new partner. They go on trips all together and such. And there was a teenager child involved as well. The divorce was a mutual agreement that they had grown apart.

But I sought it out because it had a pension and stuck to it because of the security it brought to the rest of my life. Now I'm glad I did because the pension gives me a little more freedom than I would have without it. 

But unfortunately (or fortunately) for a Daoist it really is a matter of 'figuring things out for yourself'."
Philosophical Exploration,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,,,"I think all the people on line talking about Daoism as if it's just about taking it easy, cruising through life with a smile on their faces are missing something that is intrinsic to the whole thing. Life can be really grinding and cruel. The translated literature of Daoism sometimes misses these points. 

I was asked to comment on a book by an Anglican priest who was using a quotation from a Daoist book where it talks about 'remaining whole'. She had interpreted this as meaning psychologically whole, but I did some research and the scholarly opinion was that it was a reference to punishment by amputation. That misread is somewhat emblematic of how modern people can misunderstand what people are talking about. 

I'm re-reading the Liezi right now and two images from it come immediately to mind. 

In one, Confucious sees someone gleaning in a harvested field but who is singing to himself. He goes over and talks to him and finds he's a realized man who has accepted his lot in the world. I grew up in the countryside and know how much gets left behind after harvest. (Probably a lot more now than in ancient times.) *Gleaning is a lot of work for minimal returns.* A modern re-write of the scene would be if Confucious found someone dumpster-diving and singing to himself---only I suspect that would be a lot less work for a lot more in return than gleaning a grain field in ancient times. (When I was a student I at one time so poor that I took to eating the ornamental kale that the city put in planters around the city.)  

There's also another passage where someone looks at Liezi and his wife and realizes that they look haggard from skipping meals. Someone offers him some bags of rice as relief, but he refuses. When a friend asks why, he says something to the effect that he doesn't want to be associated with that particular govt official. Shortly afterwards the official gets purged, and anyone associated with him suffers 'guilt by association'. The implication is Liezi 'dodged a bullet' by refusing the help. 

The point isn't that Daoism allows you to slide through life without bad things happening, it's that when bad things happen it gives you the insight that allows you to minimize the harm and also to not internalize it. It also allows you to understand what is really important and what is not worth fussing over.  

This gets to the next point. Daoism doesn't just teach people how to do without, it also exposes people to an entire universe of meaning that the vast majority of people don't even know exists. I'm not talking about immortal beings playing chess on mountain tops. *That's all a metaphor.* I mean the immediate beauty that surrounds us but most folks don't see because they are inward focused on their immediate problems. 

There's a Zen story about a traveling monk who is sitting out viewing the moon one night who gets held-up by a thief. The thief goes through the monk's possessions and learns to his chagrin that if anything the monk is poorer than him. Crestfallen, he slinks away feeling miserable. The monk sighs and says to himself ""If I could, I would have given him this moon"". 

This is what sustained me at my job for years. The most irritating parts of it were the 'Dominant Paradigm' (DP) people I worked for and with. They were always complaining about not making enough money and bragging about their material possessions. They said they were bored stiff all the time. I loathed the stupid ways our bosses held onto every scrap of authority they could, even though they often made really dumb mistakes simply because they were too proud to ask anyone underneath them what they thought. 

I got angry, I ground my teeth, but other times I thought to myself ""these people are teaching me lessons about how to forbear adversity and what is and isn't important"", and that would sustain me a little while later. Eventually I learned that my anger and frustration weren't going to ever end, but that they were transitory.  When I remember this, they just become waves that ebb and flow over my life.    

My belief is these are the sorts of lessons that Liezi learned from helping his wife and taking care of the pigs on his farm."

,,NEUTRAL,0.5133703947067261,"Well as someone rightly pointed out Taoism doesn't expressly say anything about relationships, but the mindset helps.

Firstly awareness of myself, my ego, my emotions. Doing the work to whittle away the insecurities and identify my true self, my nature. Once I was reasonably confident I knew my nature (work ongoing) I was able to see what didn't fit. The things I had to strive at, the things that weren't effortless and didn't bring me peace. Recognising those things, I had to accept that there would be suffering in shedding them. Not just for me but for others. I had to find a way to minimise this and not focus primarily on me, and my needs and wants. Not to cling to any particular outcome too firmly. This allowed me to be more flexible and open in my communication, less reactive, more compassionate. Acceptance is definitely key, it's not all gonna be great. You're going to suffer.

Finally I think the single biggest help for me was just the overwhelming feeling that I was doing the right thing. I feel like I'm living my life the way it was meant to be lived.  It may not end well, I may die alone (a horrifying thought for some), I may not be as rich as I could have been.

Some of the things I do are take a walk at lunch break and enjoy the flowers or clouds, and snuggle with my dog when I get home. Or watch an episode of a good show. A big key to these ""joy snacks"" is to be mindful and present and appreciative. Which is definitely daoist. 🪷

Schedule a block of time to do something you enjoy. If your wife knows it's coming up, like every Tuesday evening for an hour, then she'll figure out the cat and dinner. 😊 Find a class or meetup group and schedule it ahead of time. For me, I go to a knitting group after work every Tuesday and get up early to go the gym every Friday morning. I work other things around these because they're important to me.

The myriad living things do not come to life without it and the hundreds of affairs are not completed without it. Its greatness is such that it embraces all life without partiality. Its beneficence reaches to the tiny insects, but does not seek to be repaid. Its richness sustains all beneath the heavens and never ceases. Its bounty (德) extends to the people, and yet there is no wastage or depletion … It gives to the myriad living things, and yet places none first or last, thus it is without considerations of private or public interest … This is called the **highest De**.

Which is understandable because water itself is an expression of Tao's Te.

For example, some of water's Te are: seeking the lowest point, retreating rather than holding fast and resisting, and patience and persistence as reflected in water's action of wearing away hard substances, such as rock, slowly over time.

As the Huainanzi is an eclectic work from about 150 BCT the Huainanzi is maby quoting the Lüshi Chunqiu (about 240 BCT, also a syncretic work) and the Lüshi Chunqiu is quoting Yang Zhu (about 380 BCT).

    Records on the First Month of the Spring Season 
    
    2. The Nature of Life 
    
    Everything in the world is created by Heaven, then 
    raised by human beings. The one who knows how to act in 
    accordance with the nature of life and will not do anything to 
    damage it is addressed as the Son of Heaven. All actions 
    taken by the Son of Heaven are aimed at safeguarding the 
    lives of his people and complying with the nature of life. That 
    is why officials are appointed. They too are appointed to 
    comply with the nature of life. However, nowadays muddle- 
    headed sovereigns have appointed many officials, but that 
    only resulted in damage to the nature of life. Thus the 
    meaning and original purpose of their appointments are totally 
    lost. Similarly, troops are trained to defend their state when 
    it is threatened by foreign aggression. However, at the 
    present time, troops are trained for internal conflicts— 
    therefore, the meaning and original purpose of their training 
    and setting up are also totally lost. 
    
    According to the nature of water, it is crystal-clear. 
    Nevertheless, it cannot be clear while earth is poured into it. 
    According to the human nature, man can enjoy a long 
    lifespan. Nevertheless, longevity is not possible because life 
    is disturbed with too many external factors. Materials are 
    things used for maintaining the nature of life. Therefore, 
    they should not be considered as the purpose of life at all.
     
    However, less spiritual people of the contemporary era might 
    devote their lives to the search for material interests. Hence, 
    they do not know how to differentiate the essentials from the 
    necessities of life, so that things they consider to be 
    important might in fact be of no value. On the other hand, 
    those really important and valuable things are overlooked. As 
    a result, every action taken by these people is doomed to fail. 
    If a sovereign acts this way, he is absurd. If a court official 
    acts this way, he will offend the sovereign. And if a son acts 
    this way, he is unbearably impertinent. 
    When one of these three problems occurs in a state, it is sure to die out.

Most likely I've read something about Yang Zhu and the author wrote, those lines of Lü Buwei are influenced by  or are even quoting Yang Zhu."

My teacher probably most of the time.

He's in his 70s and from a totally different era. He's also had the resources to dedicate his whole life to Taoism and tai chi. He's basically always doing what he wants at any given moment because he has, over time, done the internal (state of mind) and external (people and things in your life) work for things to always be in a balanced state. He just kind of flows from one activity to the next. One of his senior students even wrote a book about it (Flowing the Tai Chi Way).

For me it's about creating systems, routines, rituals, and habits to make life go smoothly while also doing the ""inner"" (in quotes because there kind of isn't an inner or outer, but it's a useful distinction). You also have to build up a set of principles to go with this. Some principles are universal and some will be unique to you.

,,NEUTRAL,0.6940605640411377,"one thing to mention on this is the difference between natural and forced habits. Daoism is quite against forced habits as they are seen to deplete jing, i.e. burn up our core energy, and are not in the natural flow of things. These would be things like getting up to an alarm and doing an exact length of certain exercises each day etc. 

Organic systems and habits are ones that come about naturally and fit with our nature and situations. So e.g. we might find there's a natural time to get up without an alarm. Then we may find we generally want a little stretch in the early morning, but not feel any real need to exercise. Then maybe later when we have high energy and are wide awake, we might want to do something more vigorous.

,,NEUTRAL,0.4849768579006195,"That's the book.

Tea ceremony is a good example. It's a contained space to practice ""Flow"". Music, arts, sports, gardening, reading, writing, etc. are good places to practice ""Flow"". It's so much easier in contained spaces because the rules and skills needed are clear.

Life is basically the opposite of that. lol This is where you need to figure out the ""rules"" and necessary skills for the different activities you flow into and out of.

You just have to keep trying things, reflecting, adjusting, trying things again, etc.

Think about how long it takes to get a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Even for someone who's naturally inclined to sports. Years and years and years. This is an activity with clear rules and processes.

To have somewhat consistent Flow or experiencing ""wuwei"" requires a black belt in a bunch of different disciplines and figuring out what they are and how to do it isn't easy. Especially because as you grow you'll have to drop skills and pick up new ones.

Knowing that you'll never have a black belt in life that will last forever is a part of what's needed to be able to stay closer to Flow.

If you want to feel Flow regularly that means you need expertise in a lot of different domains.

One way to make it less complicated is by simplifying your life, and this is why a lot of people do that. I do it as well.

Even the process of simplification can be complex depending on where you are when you start.

Just think about two different people.

One lives in the mountains, hunts and grows their own food, collects rainwater to drink, makes their own clothes, and spends their free time doing hobbies enjoyable to them.

Regularly staying in or close to Flow will be simple and easy 

The other person is a part-time worker at Walmart, has two kids, money is always tight, plays video games (note: something I love to do!), and is overweight.

They might only experience that Flow feeling while gaming. In order to feel Flow more consistently they might need to get disciplined about money, start exercising, play video games less, invest time in learning to find ways to make more money, etc.

The path to feel regular Flow for them is more complex.

On top of all of this, people have traumas to unpack, bath relationships to mend, mental health challenges (like ADHD, or bipolar disorder, I have the second one, etc.)

There usually isn't a quick and easy fix to having consistent Flow. There might be for some people, but it will be because they've already mastered most of the elements in their life. They already put in the time.

There's not enough information about what you're worrying about to give you any sort of useful answer. It's often the case that mental illness or neurodivergence causes similar issues.

Looking at the DDJ and Zhuangzi, the closest teachings to this would be about your competence level and whether you are going beyond your role. If you become more competent you won't worry about completing in time, and if you limit yourself to your role you won't worry about anything outside that role.

Suppose your issue is you're a student who needs to study for an exam and also needs to feel loved by being social during the same period. While you're having fun, you will be worried about your need to study, and while you're studying, you will worry about your social life. Accepting that your role is a student is a simple way to address this so you can study without worry, but you might also raise your competence in studying so that you have plenty of time for relaxation with friends. This might mean going to the right people for help, doubling up activities like exercise while listening to lectures or study groups."

They're all kind of based on the basic idea of setting aside a specific amount of time to do something and staying focused on that thing.

I'm sure there are many other methods and philosophies around managing time. Play around with some and find something that works for you.

I usually do a relaxed kind of time blocking that isn't tied to a strict schedule and I come up with it at the start of the day (just in my head) and make adjustments along the way.

It works for me because I don't have a lot of responsibilities at work or home. I think the more regimented version can be freeing for people who have to manage a lot of different tasks throughout the day.

First we practice becoming aware of when we are acting from stress and pushing the river.

With practice we eventually begin to identify our stressed reactions sooner and sooner in the process. 

Whenever this occurs, pause, try to mentally physically relax, and attempt to finish with a calmer, less stressed, mindset.

**A sane frame of mind is when you have an inward facility for access to essence while outwardly acting according with justice and following reason, not being tied up in things.**   
**Perverse moods are progressive search for richer taste, wanton indulgence in sound and form, fits of elation and rage, heedlessness of negative aftereffects.**   
**Sanity and perversity hurt each other, desire and essence harm each other. They cannot stand together; when one rises, the other passes away. Therefore sages reduce desire to follow essence.**  
**The eye likes form and color, the ear likes sound, the nose likes fragrance, the mouth likes flavor. All together, there is always benefit and harm associated with them.**   
**As for habitual desires, the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth do not know what to want; in each case it is the mind that controls this, each in its place. From this perspective, it is clear that desire cannot be overcome.**"

The qi builds and reaches a level/quality where it has its own intelligence. The releasing of tensions opens the system for qi to play out through us. So as the energy builds and resistance to its flow diminishes, we gradually move into a more natural state of flow. Part of this is also that the qi pushes out into the world around us, and so we connect our energy with the energy of the world unfolding around us, and so we flow naturally with it.

,,NEUTRAL,0.4395589530467987,"If a person is perfectly content, they can act effortlessly even while thinking about it. Wu wei occurs naturally at all times in the mind of a person who has let go completely. It's not really a paradox, imho.

OP talks about anxiety standing in his way, for example. It's all a matter of what the mind currently trusts most. If the mind trusts striving and planning to keep it safe, it will default to anxiety to solve a problem. The sage has put complete trust in the unencumbered mind, so it defaults to that in order to solve problems. That's wu wei.

To arrive at that level of trust, a person has to actually try out the non-striving, non-planning mind in the face of adversity and see how much better it fares first-hand. I see most Taoist texts as simple encouragement, like, ""hey, have you tried just giving up completely and letting things play out as they will? You'll feel so much better and everything will be so easy to manage because you feel so free. It's like you're doing nothing at all!""

Put another way, if OP wants to experience wu wei instead of anxiety, they just need to let their mind go to the places that feel reckless. It feels reckless to stop listening to anxious thoughts. It feel like abandoning responsibilities or throwing yourself to the wolves. It feels wrong to abandon effort when every part of your mind is screaming at you to take control--like letting go of the steering wheel on the freeway. You can be the one to do it, though. You don't have to completely lose track of yourself. It's really just a decision you make. Like, ""oh, I can just give up on this. I can just drop *everything* can't I?""

Be free from cares to be carefree. Drop everything to be unencumbered. It's a choice, not a mystery, not esoteric, not a paradox. It's just a choice we absolutely don't want to make, so it seems paradoxical that it would have such good results and feel so wonderful."

Once the method was learned, efficient, inconsistent and persistent practice led to the natural consequence of wu wei.

Wu Wei is not a physically inactive practice. 

Wu Wei occurs naturally when we practice mental non-interference with practice. 

Mental non-interference requires practice as well, because we have formed habits of interfering mentally and emotionally with practice due to our mind habit of imposing emotional imperatives upon our practice. 

All skills require an efficient, consistent and persistent form of practice. 

This efficient, consistent and persistent practice is a method.

In further relation to that, I feel like most people have experienced Wu Wei. Practicing Wu Wei is something that comes as a natural consequence of gaining skill, if I'm not mistaken."
Philosophical Exploration,Effortlessness in Action,,,"And here I thought Wu Wei was acting on intuition guided by our Te but you speak with such bullshit I mean authority that people actually might believe. For someone who says so much you sure say so little.


Children are a wonderful example of why I make such a statement. Children learn a lot from watching others sure but I know many children climb trees that have never seen someone climb a tree before. Children typically start to talk before their brains are developed enough to understand the practical use of speech. Sure children can see others walking but they don't get taught the necessary things like controlling balance, how to push off the ground effectively. All the things which become natural had to be learned. Learning can come from many places not just a teacher. Knowledge doesn't even necessarily need a source. Example do you know why the sky is blue? The sky is blue do to refraction with the water dispersing the light across the atmosphere. Not exactly something that can be taught. When we speak of teaching you do realize that requires a first learner right? I mean the Chuang Tzu's butchers teacher had to learn somehow. Whether that be learning on their own or having a teacher. However if you go far enough back everything taught and learned had to be learned before it could be taught. This is Wu Wei, intuition of when to act even if that act is stillness. 


Mental non-interference like wtf are you saying lil bro. When practicing meditation your supposed to be present and observe without judgement. Wu Wei your supposed to rely on your Te intuition to guide your actions neither of those have anything to do with ""mental interference"" in fact mental interference is something we are supposed to accept during meditation. Our minds should wander it is not a bad thing. 


No skills require anything. You want to learn to be a boxer? You want to learn pikaboo, philly shell, bob and weave, ect.... Sure there are established methods of learning to be a boxer and to be frank any of those listed are great to learn an established method but what about the creators? Did they have a consistent, persistent and efficient training method? Second do you think the easy way is the way you should follow?


I knew a guy who was born without hands in highschool. They could easily knock your lights out with a ""punch"" yet they didn't have anything past their wrist. So if fisticuffs can be done without fists and they had to learn how to hit with their own ""hands"". They used to tell me about how they had to change how they impacted, changed the way they have to hold their arms. The efficient and established methods are great but by no means necessary. 


Stop imposing our emotions to reach automatic action that is probably the funniest line in your whole comment. So your saying you never subconsciously popped a boner, never seen anyone act automatically in anger, never heard the sadness of an employee spouting welcome to xyz may I take your order? In several cases we act without thinking because of emotions; in fact temporary insanity pleas in court are based on that foundation. The foundation that somethings can be so bad that we cannot hold a person reasonably sane for the time of the event simply because of how crazy the emotions were. Yet to you emotions get in the way of the ability to act without thought? I mean I can cook and clean without feeling any way about it but I can also walk down the road and absolutely hate it. Does that mean cooking and cleaning are automatic? Does this mean that walking isn't?"
Practical Taoism,Taoist Practice and Non-Attachment,POSITIVE,0.6053853631019592,"Yes, very good! 🙂👍

All of this is self-evident once we reflect upon our own real life experiences. 

Any skill practiced enough and long enough will eventually begin to occur on its own without our mental interference. 

This includes walking, eating, brushing our teeth, driving, riding a bicycle, experienced musicians see this with their play and advanced athletes with their athletic performance. 

Our biggest interference occurs when we impose an emotional imperative to perform well upon ourselves before the skill has been effectively developed.

This quote in particular - 

“Tao sits at the root of the Taoist universe. Though it’s often translated as “way”, there’s no English equivalent—even in Chinese it has a variety of meanings. For now, it’s best to let this word sit vacuous, devoid of a referent. Better to infer its meaning through exposure.”"

,,NEUTRAL,0.5497205257415771,"""Naming"" something is defining it or objectifying it. A name has opinions attached to it. People can understand the Tao, but when you start to define it and draw lines around it it's no longer the actual Tao, it's just conversations about it with opinions and lines. I think the first verse is saying, ""This book is about the Tao, but it's not the actual Tao."" Like a statement of humility, or a disclaimer.

In terms of emptying your mind, I'm assuming you're talking about verse 3? There aren't any lines about emptying the mind in the first verse. 

I think the idea at the heart of Taoism is fairly simple. The sage lets go of direct control over the world and puts their faith in the relaxed and unencumbered mind to accomplish what needs to be done. The ""thing"" the sage has faith in is the Tao. ""Tao"" can be a placeholder for fate, or luck, or unconscious mind, or natural conditioning, or instinct, etc.

Basically, look at your mind, identify all forms of striving, trying, doing, planning, etc. and give up on it. See what happens. It can feel reckless or wrong to do that, but the result is wu wei, or action without effort. The sage is ""carefree,"" as in, they have no cares or worries. This is a decision they make because they trust that unencumbered mind to steer their life better than the striving mind can. Being unencumbered isn't a result of the practice, it is the practice itself. It's abandonment of responsibility and the sense of importance.

Put another way, if you are perfectly at ease, content, and happy, you will be the best decision maker you can be, you will be the best friend you can be, and everything you do will feel easy because you don't have to push for it. It can feel very backwards, but by removing all effort, you become a more effective person. The sage has seen this first hand enough times to put their full faith in it, and they have emptied out their mind of all striving. This is the ""way"" they are following."
Philosophical Exploration,Understanding Taoism Through Textual Interpretation,NEGATIVE,0.6865968704223633,"Verse 1, and repeated throughout the work, points out how language is inadequate for representing the Tao.  Anything put into words is by nature incomplete.  Inadequate.  Incorrect.  Contradictory.  So no matter how well you understand it, you cannot think it, or state it, or communicate it accurately.

We can talk about it, but the point is that nothing you can say about it is correct.  And when we think, we think in words.  So the flaw lies there also.

We learn to understand the Tao by emptying our mind of thoughts, observing, embracing contradiction, and moving toward what sits between them.  We remember that all words are flawed, but that they come from someone who may simply be using an imperfect tool to communicate something true.  Just like we do."

*You* 遊 is a crucial term for understanding the *Zhuangzi*. Translated as “play,” “free play,” and “wandering,” it is usually defined as an ideal, playful Zhuangzian way of being. There are two problems with this definition. The first is logical: the *Zhuangzi* cannot consistently recommend playfulness as an ideal, since doing so vitiates the essence of *you*—it becomes an ethical imperative instead of an activity freely undertaken for its own sake. The second problem is performative: arguments for playful Zhuangzi as exemplar resemble those of the logicians and philosophers who appear to come in for Zhuangzian criticism. This essay addresses these tensions by demonstrating how the *Zhuangzi* ambiguates the nature and value of *you*. Apparent endorsements of *you* are not freestanding, instead occurring in grudging replies of teachers to overly zealous students. In light of this recontextualization, a new version of *you* is offered that accommodates “non-playful” ways of being.

Philosophical Exploration,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,,,"Here's an entry in the massive Encyclopedia of Taoism written up by Christine MOLLIER:

**beidou 北 斗 Northern Dipper** 

Since early times, the Northern Dipper (Ursa Major) has played a fundamental role in Chinese official and religious life, due to its importance in the astrocalendrical calculations and its mighty apotropaic powers. The basic features of its roles in Taoism are already apparent in the Han period: in the Shiji (Records of the Historian, j. 27; trans. Chavannes 1895–1905, 3: 339– 43), the Dipper is associated with the pole star as the heavenly center of the world, and is the residence of the Great One (\*Taiyi); its rotation divides the world into the Nine Palaces (\*jiugong). The Dipper, therefore, rules over Heaven and Earth and symbolizes the complex unity of the cosmos. Its earthly counterpart is Mount \*Kunlun, the axis of the world. Within the human body, the Dipper is located in its three centers—at the level of the head, the heart, and the navel—and is related to the Three Ones (\*sanyi). It is also associated with the spleen, the organ related to Soil and the Center in the \*wuxing pattern. Since the color of Soil is yellow, alchemical texts call the Dipper the “yellow star” (huangxing 黃星), and one of its synonyms is Yellow Dame (huangpo 黃 婆). 

However, the Dipper lies in the North and thus symbolizes the Origin, which embraces beginning and end and subsumes both Yin and Yang. Many terms used to describe the Dipper give it the qualities of the Origin and pivot of the universe, and the days of the “return to the Origin” (huiyuan 迴元) are consecrated to it. The Dipper therefore has a double nature: it is linked with life and death and is associated with the idea of passage, and also divides good from evil and grants punishments and rewards. All the symbols that represent the connection between unity and multiplicity are closely related to it. 

The Dipper consists of nine stars, number 9 being that of the Great Yang (taiyang 太陽) and of totality. Four stars are located in the scoop, three in the handle, and two are invisible (see fig. 23). The latter, called Fu 輔 and Bi 弼, are its assistants. Those who can see them, under strict conditions of purity, enjoy a life span of several hundred years. Each star is inhabited by divinities, and encloses a paradise similar to those in the Moon and Sun. According to some texts, the nine stars have counterparts which form another invisible constellation surrounding the first one. These nine supplementary stars illuminate the Dipper; they are the celestial-Yang and earthly-Yin souls (\*hun and po) of the Dipper, and are inhabited by the spouses of its kings. Within the human body, the spirits of these “black stars” reside in the Hall of Light (\*mingtang) located in the brain, and their titles suggest that their function is to protect the embryo. Thus the celestial world appears to be inverted: the female, Yin, and dark entities are outside, while the male, Yang, and luminous ones are within. In fact, the Dipper is said to be “the natural fire contained in the Yin.”

In Taoism, the Dipper has four major roles, all related to its dual aspect. First, the Dipper indicates the proper orientation for performing meditation or rituals through the apparent movement of its “handle.” Second, it has strong exorcistic powers as a divinity of the North and of the underworld. Adepts, for example, cover themselves with its stars by visualizing them descending directly above their heads, or surrounding them. Analogously, in the Thunder Rituals (\*leifa), the thunder is summoned from the direction to which the Dipper points (called the Gate of the Vital Force, \*mingmen) in order to expel demons. Third, the Dipper is the recipient of invocations to ask forgiveness for one's sins and to have one's name erased from the registers of death (siji 死籍). Fourth, it opens the way to heaven (its seventh star is called Tianguan 天關 or Heavenly Pass) in both meditation and ritual. This may take place within the framework of exercises whose purpose is to unify the adept and deities pertaining to the practices of Guarding the One (\*shouyi). The best known of these exercises is “walking along the guideline” (\*bugang), frequently related to the practice of “spreading open the Barrier of Heaven” (tianguan 天 關; Kroll 1986b)."

Philosophical Exploration,Taoist Philosophy on Naturalness and Virtue,NEUTRAL,0.6621724367141724,"Fun linguistic fact: **相 xiang**, the word that most translations resolve as **""each other""** can also mean *appraise, assess, inspect, gauge, estimate* (as per Kroll's Classical Chinese dictionary). With this, it's possible to interpret the lines as follows:

Therefore, ""what is"" and ""what isn't"" [are used to] gauge creation; ""difficult"" and ""easy"" gauge completion; ""long"" and ""short"" gauge proportion; ""high"" and ""low"" gauge steepness; ""tone"" and ""note"" (or ""rumors"" and ""good repute"") gauge harmony; ""before"" and ""after"" gauge sequence.

故有無相生，難易相成，長短相較，高下相傾，音聲相和，前後相隨。

Practical Taoism,Taoist Practice and Non-Attachment,NEUTRAL,0.6150522828102112,"Keep in mind hard/easy, and other measurements, are a mental imposition we impose upon events. 

We fix a  goal within our mind and then assign an emotional value upon achieving this goal. 

Then, whenever we measure our performance with imposed emotional value against the goal and find ourselves falling short of the goal, we experience displeasure expressed as unhappiness, frustration, anger, etc. 

The idea is to develop the mental skill of setting a goal, or purpose, absent our imposition of emotional attachment to the outcome. 

That is, deciding we emotionally ""need"" the outcome we wish before we allow ourselves to be content. 

Think of it this way, 

A river doesn't ""try"" to flow to the Sea. It merely follows its natural course, its path, and allows the outcome to be what the outcome becomes. 

In the same way, there is a certain process for humans achieving a decided upon goal. 

It is a pattern of practicing the required skills that are necessary in order to obtain that goal. 

When we apply ourselves to the skill practice, keeping the end goal in mind, but absent mental and emotional interference, or insisting upon our specified outcome, we allow the skill practice process to work for us unobstructed by our mental interference, and the outcome occurs naturally, as a consequence of the process. 

This is learning to stop interfering with Tao's naturally occurring process and centering ourselves within ourselves while allowing outward processes to flow on their own."

>**音声相和 Music and voice harmonize one another;** 

>**前後相随 Front and rear follow one another:** 

>**恒也 These are constant.** 

>**是以 That is why** 

>**圣人处无为之事 The sage handles affairs by Non-doing (wuwei),**

>**行不言之教 And practices teaching by not speaking.** 

>**万物作而弗始 He lets all things happen but does not initiate,** 

>**生而弗有 Lets them grow but does not possess,** 

>**为而弗恃 Gets things done but does not take advantage,** 

>**功成而弗居 Achieves his goal but claims no credit.** 

>**夫唯弗居 Just because he claims no credit,** 

>**是以不去 His credit does not go away.**

>**Commentary:-**

>**In the first stanza Laozi is making a couple of statements that may sound contradictory or even absurd at first. But, upon closer examination, they turn out to be wise discernment of the truths in life. Such statements are paradoxes, and by invoking paradoxes Laozi teaches us how to transcend the differences forged by the human mind and be at peace with Nature’s creations. For example, Nature or Dao created the “ten thousand things under Heaven” without making distinctions between the ugly and the beautiful, the good and the not good. It is only we humans who created such distinctions. It is we humans who crave for the beautiful and good and loathe the ugly and the not good. Such cravings and loathing lead to strife and agony, and that in itself is ugly and not good.** 

>**Following the two paradoxes about beauty and good versus ugliness and not good, Laozi posits one of mankind’s first cracks at relativity—the interdependence of opposites such as Being versus Nonbeing, easy versus difficult, long versus short, and so on. “Music and voice,” by the way, refers to instrumental and vocal music. Then, in one of Laozi’s characteristic sequences, marked by his use of “therefore” and “thus” and “that is why,” he teaches us how to follow the sage’s behavior accordingly. Given the received order of the chapters, this is Laozi’s first mention of his hero 圣人 (shèng rén) or “sage.” To Laozi, the sage is not so much a moral exemplar as someone who is endowed with the wisdom to get things done without any arbitrary or self-serving action. Such a notion of wise “Non-doing” or “not doing,” known as 无为 (wú wéi), is going to become a leitmotif that runs throughout the pages of this book, but here the author seems to throw it out casually as if it was a familiar term, suggesting that he is probably not the first user of the expression. However, Laozi does go on to elaborate what he means by “Non-doing” or “not doing” and clinches the point by a guaranteed reward: “Just because he claims no credit, his credit does not go away.” This closing sentence strongly suggests that Laozi’s philosophy is not just about pure metaphysics or ethics but has the applicative value of gaining the desired result with the least effort.** 

>**A word may be said about “teaching without speaking” or “teaching without words.” Posterity has ridiculed Laozi by citing his work of five thousand words as rebuttal to his own principle. While recognizing the ineffability of Dao as the sage implies, we need not take his words literally and attempt a total denial of the role of words in teaching.(Charles Q.Wu)**"

,,NEUTRAL,0.6411219239234924,"Sharing my observations.

Much of the modern and Western writing on Eastern practice subjects tends to dilute or distort the original teachings—often reinterpreting them to fit contemporary frameworks or personal philosophies. As a result, key nuances are lost, and the depth of the tradition is compromised. For those who truly wish to understand these systems, it's essential to study the original texts in their native language. While modern Mandarin is helpful, it's important to recognize that many classical texts are written in Classical Chinese, which differs significantly in grammar, vocabulary, and style from the modern vernacular.

It's also worth noting that many of these classical manuscripts were intentionally written in cryptic, symbolic, or riddle-like language. This was a deliberate measure by the masters of the time to guard esoteric knowledge from the uninitiated—much like the veiled language used in Western alchemical texts. Understanding these works requires not just a grasp of Classical Chinese, but also a contextual awareness of the culture, philosophy, and oral traditions in which they were embedded.

With this context, it's easier to understand how modern and Western writers may have misinterpreted or oversimplified the original manuscripts.

Taiji put in easy terms, is advanced qigong with energy cultivation.

Breath exercises, meditation, and Qigong do all use breath control, but they are fundamentally different because of their intentions, methods, and contexts."

5. The recent film ""Everything everywhere all at once""

Master Dongguo asked Zhuangzi, “This thing called the Way—where does it exist?”
Zhuangzi, said, “There’s no place it doesn’t exist.”
“Come,” said Master Dongguo, “you must be more specific!”
“It is in the ant.”
“As low a thing as that?”
“It is in the panic grass.”
“But that’s lower still!”
“It is in the tiles and shards.”
“How can it be so low?”
“It is in the piss and shit!”

Personally I have a deep gratitude for qigong, I practiced yoga for many years and still do which also brought practices and philosophies into my life that have deeply helped me, but in a time I found myself in a kind of existential crises where it wasn't able to help me with my anxiety, qigong's different approach to energy helped me achieve more ballance. 
(This is absolutely in no way a diss on yoga, or saying one is better or worse, both are vast groups of systems with huge history, internal variety and incredible merit. Some things are somewhat similar or mirrored in them in ways that seem subtle and profound, and it is in a way the differences that have helped me greatly)

For headaches even some of the simplest qigong moving and breathing forms have helped me.

Edit: may sound random but adding to the list of hits cuz I was reminded of this - healthy non bound feet for Chinese women. Daoist priestesses did not bind their feet when this fortunately outdated practice still took place in China, and were sometimes mocked for this."
,,NEUTRAL,0.5341317653656006,"To me, the great lesson of Dao is how to view life and live life in a way that allows me to be at peace and harmony with the course of living. I've come to see the meaning and purpose of life is simply to live it. 

In order to do that, one needs to develop a degree of selflessness ... to consider others before oneself. There is no end to and no satisfying the self-centered desires that the mind can manufacture.  If all of one's time and effort is consumed chasing selfish desires, there will be no peace and harmony with the course of living.

Is Dao the answer? I think it can be if approached in the right manner. In certain Daoist meditation approaches, the first step is to believe. That is, have faith that there is something to it, even though not readily apparent. Such a faith allows one to move on to the next step. It is the initial inspiration that draws one into the practice. It is not really a rational thing ... more of an intuitive feeling. 

Undertaking the journey with Dao requires a bit of a leap of faith. As already pointed out, it is not a goal but a process ... an ongoing process. Repeated readings of the classic texts ... Laozi, Zhuangzi,  Liezi and others, by different translators ... over time, teaches one to see life and being differently. 

Just a few thoughts. Hope you can find them helpful.

Yeah, I'm a path. I want to write a book but I hate fame. That's where I am at on my path. 

My life coach was homeless and angry. I just shouldn't have kept him around as long. He lectured me like he was the master but he does that with everyone including many women. Intelligent man. But not happy on his path, yet happy at times. He practices in front of his van that he sleeps in every morning. A van I helped him buy.

Also, Mitchell admitted he didn't understand a word of Chinese, yet he claimed his translation was superior to other translations because he'd practised Zen meditation. The reason it resonates with so many Western readers is that it confirms their naive tree-hugging biases. Such people aren't interested in what the Chinese text has to say!"

Philosophical Exploration,Translation Quality and Fidelity in Taoism Texts,NEGATIVE,0.6888709664344788,"It’s condescending of you to dismiss the criticisms as condescending. Here’s a direct quote from Mitchell: 
~~~~~~~~~
I once got some flak from orthodox Taoists who became very irate that my version of the “Tao Te Ching” was not a translation, that I would take off at certain points and throw the original out the window and do variations on the original theme. It wasn’t a translation, so I had that privilege, I felt. But this did not make them happy.
~~~~~~~~~
Source: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/conversation-stephen-mitchell

So he “throws the original out the window” and “takes off” in some other woo-woo direction. Which is to say, it isn’t a translation. Not an opinion, condescending or otherwise, but a statement of fact."
Philosophical Exploration,Translation Quality and Fidelity in Taoism Texts,NEGATIVE,0.813327431678772,"In objective terms, Mitchell's version is one of the least true-to-the-source works among the hundreds of translations and interpretations of the Tao Te Ching. He made it in four months with no knowledge of the source language, heavily paraphrasing and even inventing (and deleting) much of the content. Mitchell's version is a major source of confusion and misquotes regarding what Lao Tzu supposedly tried to state."
Philosophical Exploration,Translation Quality and Fidelity in Taoism Texts,POSITIVE,0.8199729919433594,"As you will see, there are strong differences of opinion about the Mitchell translation. It was also the first version that I read, and I still like it very much. That being said it will be important as you go on to read other versions too. As it’s critics, say, it definitely takes a westernized and somewhat informal approach. I think that makes it more accessible for people at least at the start.

The good news is there’s no reason you have to pick one over another. There are dozens of them. I’ve found value in most of them. Here’s a link to dozens of different translations. Try them out and see which ones you like best. I rarely talk about an issue without looking at more than just one translation.

,,POSITIVE,0.9250246286392212,"Having said all that. S Mitchell's is one of my favorite versions. It reminds me of Kraft Mac & Cheese. With it's orange dye and weird noodles and powder. S Mitchell made the TTC very accessible to me, it resonated with me like the other more ""accurate"" versions did not. From what I researched there really was no one official historical version of the TTC, but many, with different number and order of chapters and different turn if phases, the received version we have now is but one of those.   I have sence moved on to other versions of the TTC and interpretations. My favorite is my own that I did in private (much like s Mitchell s version) because it was my quest to internalize and understand. I find the truth doesn't care the messenger, and my path reveals itself in many cool ways.  Enjoy your journey!"

Philosophical Exploration,Understanding Taoism Through Textual Interpretation,NEUTRAL,0.6555953621864319,"The line (道可道，非常道。) directly says ""Tao can tao is not eternal/constant Tao"".

It can be interpreted as ""Where the word 道 'tao' can be understood/meant as a way or priciple (i.e. normal non-Taoist meanings of the word 道), it is not the metaphysically eternal and ultimate 'Tao' that will be a major topic in this text and philosophy"".

The ""naming"" is not merely about giving something a name, but it's all about a more fundamental cognitive function: categorization. We perceive things and conceptualize them through abstract concepts. Thus, we put them into their respective ""boxes"". By the very nature of this process, it creates the distinction between what is in a concept and what is outside. No concept can fully capture the variance of perceptual sensations, perspectives, etc. Reality is always richer than the concepts we use to think about describe it with.

So, any conceptualization of Dao is inherently missing (or, makes us blind) something from it.

I believe this interpretation is supported, as Daoism focuses on spontaneous action (wu wei), which necessarily requires not planning (so, not thinking about what to do) and sees the human affairs are rigid and artificial."
