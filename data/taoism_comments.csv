A lot of Taoists have a somewhat ‘selfish’ view of existence that they use to justify pain and suffering. I think it’s important to realize a lot of philosophies like Taoism are about coping with existence and reality, which is fine, but for more politically minded people that mindset is simply outdated when it comes to things like homelessness.

Everyone has a difficult and easy life. We all make the choices that seem the most beneficial to us. You may be right that he's not doing well - but compared to what? Compared to what he \*could've\* been, perhaps he's doing his best. Most likely, that is true.

Perhaps his mental state, his intoxication, his physical state -things that you find unbearable, unthinkable- are this man's eden, his salvation, his release? Sensations that would shock and appall you are the life source of his being, carrying him forward day-to-day?

How do you judge his peace? Even if he's screaming, trashing, looking livid - why are those things \*innately\* bad?

Do you have no hardships in life? Do you view the same hardships and the tools you deal with them in the same vein? He also has hardships in his life, and he has his own tools. Tools that would not make sense to you. Tools that perhaps, ultimately, that could've been better. Were you never an infant? Did you never learn anything at all, in life? Everyone learns something along the way, everyone makes mistakes. We iterate, recalibrate, and carry on.

The man is just is. But he reflects highly your own emotional stance and assumptions. It's a delightful excuse to reflect our preconcieved notions. Why do you assume to judge for him? Did he ask for your help?

DDJ's Chapter 20 ""Being Different"" from Ursula LeGuin is amazing for this situation, I feel:

""How much difference between yes and no? What difference between good and bad? What the people fear must be feared. O desolation! Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit! Everybody’s cheerful, cheerful as if at a party, or climbing a tower in springtime. And here I sit unmoved, clueless, like a child, a baby too young to smile. Forlorn, forlorn.

1kn2via,msgoa8s,t3_1kn2via,CloudwalkingOwl,"Two answers. 

Years ago an elderly woman hired me to fix a few things in her home. We got to talking and she asked me about Daoism, specifically how it responded to the Holocaust (I think she was Jewish). My response, immediate, from the gut, was ""about as well as any other religion--I'm not sure any of them have a good answer"". She seemed to find that a good response.

The other thing to remember is that homeless guy didn't just pop into existence because of some sort of Cosmic event. Homelessness is bye-and-large a result of specific policies taken by our government. In my home town, for example, I can remember the day when all the beggars suddenly showed up in the downtown. That was because the Conservative provincial govt cut welfare and disability payments by 20% for everyone. That meant people who were just getting by on their disability pensions or welfare cheques, all suffered a catastrophic loss of income.

Now we have an explosion of homelessness because the federal govt stopped building social housing in the 1990s, the provincial govt refused to force municipalities to let cities build enough housing, municipalities zoned most of the land in cities so the only thing you can build on it is single-detached homes that require a car to live in, and most homeowners fight tooth and nail against any new apartments or rent-geared-to-income in their neighbourhoods. 

Learning how the city operates and the real cause of beggars and homelessness is learning the Dao of the city. If you are upset about the individual, then get involved in trying to deal with these problems. The doing without doing comes down to understanding where the problem originates and learning the most efficient way of fixing it. Daoism offers you a toolbox that you can use to understand, navigate, and work in the world we inhabit. But that's where the 'kung fu' and 'eating bitter' part of Daoism come into play.

1kn2via,msf4j02,t3_1kn2via,becomingShay,"I think my biggest struggle when learning about the Tao (and I still have much to learn so my understanding may be wrong) however, from the understanding I have. The only thing that didn’t sit well with me was the concept of not interfering with what exists or is happening. 

The example I recall was about a tree in a stream. The tree branches don’t move for the water, but the water still finds a way to flow. 

Which is lovely in theory. 

In reality I find that much harder. I think the real question here would be, how can we watch suffering and offer no help? I understand that the teachings of the Tao are that we don’t interfere. It’s just that I believe there are times we should offer our help. 

So for me I suppose, the answer to your question would be that, the man you saw is having his own experience and right now part of his experience is the struggle he is facing with addiction and poor mental health. It’s not fair, but there is value in all lessons for those of us who are fortunate to find them. The deeper question for me would be, how can I walk past that man and not offer him help? Or not call someone else who may be able to help him? 

I’m open to hearing other perspectives on this. Because I’d like a broader understanding of this too.

Calm and unperturbed, the parent responds with care, meeting the baby’s needs without sharing in its distress. Parents learn what cries mean, and how to best respond.   Its not that the parent thinks  - no big deal, the baby is over-reacting.  It is quite the opposite, the parent knows to now turn their energy and resources towards the baby to help out. 

The man’s that  you saw in the street, his suffering is not a flaw or failure but a natural part of universe’s unfolding.  A message for the other caregivers to respond to.

I am a HS teacher, and a lot of the suffering I see in my students are like baby cries.  “I can’t believe they told my secret”, “It is not fair that she got to… and I did not”, etc. etc.  And again it’s not that I think – “no big deal” – I wonder what I can do to help.

1kn2via,msfj6dz,t1_msezdml,Rob_LeMatic,"I struggle with this as well. 

The best I've been able to come to terms with suffering is that the ten thousand things exist because they all exist. To deny any one of them is to deny existence, and of the infinite dimensions, not existing is more likely than existing. There is a smaller finite set of infinite universes in which the laws of physics exist in such a way they allow for matter and energy to interact in space time as we observe them. Most of the variations are a null set. 

So if suffering exists, it has to occupy some part of the universe. You directly experience it, or you observe someone else experiencing it. They are your loved one, or a stranger, or an enemy. There are levels of distance from suffering and levels of intensity. Do we have a choice in whether or not we encounter suffering or experience it in some of its aspects? 

I think that if existence is truly infinite and limitless, then at some point we have been everyone and experienced every permutation. Like everything else you encounter, suffering leaves an impression on you, it shapes you, sometimes it spurs you to action. 

The what of that can go every which way. It might move you to do works to lessen the suffering of others. Or to help this man specifically. Maybe you give him a dollar. Maybe you take him into your home and get him the best help you can. Maybe he blossoms under this care and later when you are in need he returns the favor, or pays it forward to someone else. Or maybe he takes advantage, robs you, or beats you. Kills your pet. Maybe you just ruminate on the implications of knowing there is suffering that you are not preventing. You could seek a life of comfort and strive to avoid suffering. Or any number of possibilities. 

Who you are shapes how you engage suffering, and encountering suffering changes your shape. Maybe you have the ability to exert your will on the outcome of the impact, or maybe you just observe it passively. 

Trying to accept the existence of suffering has at times driven me out of my mind. So you ask yourself, if you were the emperor of all existence and could eliminate suffering, where would you draw the lines? That has the potential to lead to some very dark thoughts. Eventually, you end up erasing all of existence. 

There is no static state, though. Suffering is as temporary as everything else. Become acquainted with it but don't let it consume you

I think you’re right, that there are different times where different behaviours are more appropriate. I think in relation to what you shared about when the appropriate time to help someone might be, the thing I understood most was 

‘is their problem self-imposed to such an extent that my interference would mean nothing’ 

For me, it makes the most sense not to help in this situation because sharing the burden of suffering if my help has no impact, doesn’t seem helpful to anyone. 

I do struggle more so with the idea of 

‘Will attempting to help someone throw my whole life into chaos…’

That’s most definitely a ‘me’ issue. I do help others sometimes at my own expense, and I suppose for me I often reason that with the fact that they are better off, even if I’m not. I think it comes from a place of being taught that my needs, wants or desires don’t supersede that of anyone else’s. So how do I knowingly ignore someone else’s need for help? Even if it comes at my expense, If that makes sense. 

That’s obviously a much different tangent to the question OP is asking, and is a much more personal journey of understanding for myself. I suppose I’m just learning, and part of my journey is having to figure out when it is and isn’t okay to let myself get hurt, if it benefits someone else. If that makes sense? Not in the context of someone else intentionally hurting me, of course. Just, in general life. If I can help, I do. Perhaps I shouldn’t always.",2,1747305283.0,2

I think perhaps I struggle with the concept of ‘This isn’t my responsibility, so I won’t help’ because it was something I heard a lot by people who could have stopped my childhood abuse, but didn’t. So now I feel internal pushback when people turn the other cheek instead of helping others. 

Equally, I will often sacrifice my own peace, in order to help someone else even if it hurts me. Which I suppose comes from putting other people’s needs above my own, as that often went hand in hand with my experiences too. 

I think I also want to always help, because I know how hard it is to need help and not have it. Which is something I don’t ever want anyone else to feel or experience. 

I like your perspective of revisiting and reevaluating our relationships with our own suffering and the suffering of others.

I don’t know if I have ever heard someone who doesn’t speak Chinese say it. And normally they say it in Chinese. I only hear it aloud in English so much cause my partner and I say it aloud to each other all the time in English cause it is funnier in a English for some reason and English is our native language. 

But as you have Chinese family maybe you were exposed from them. So my theory still stands. 

I have Chinese family too and that is absolutely where we got it from. I don’t know if non-family will ever get exasperated enough with you to just be like “there is no why!!!!” 🤣 But Chinese family will say it to you all the time. You ask them why this or that and when they can’t come up with a reason they tell you there is no why. 

It’s funny though cause it has this sort of short circuit effect on my brain in a way that “just because” as an answer doesn’t, even though they are essentially the same thing.

They are both sort of nonsense answers in their own ways… but for me putting focus on the question makes me think I am asking the wrong question or my perspective is off. The question itself is not one worth asking because I am not seeing the situation clearly. Where as the focus on the answer with “just because” feels oddly disheartening and without recourse to understand further.

The focus on the question itself is more effective for me as it redirects me to seek a different perspective and find a new question to ask. So when someone says “there is no why” I can move on to seeking other questions to ask without dwelling on the fact I came up with no answers for that question. Some puzzles/problems/equations are unsolvable. The question is a like a puzzle you are trying to solve about some aspect of reality and sometimes you are stuck on an unsolvable puzzle. So just move on. Focus on a solvable one for now.

To me it seems that there are at least two separate questions here. 

The easy one is whether having hobbies like art and music are in keeping with the notion of effortless action. You might not remember it, but learning to walk did not come effortlessly to any of us. It is a struggle and requires trying over and over again, often falling on your butt, before you catch the logic to it. But once you do, it becomes effortless. Every time you stand up, you don't put any thought into how to keep your balance. Not anymore and not for a long time. 

That is flowing with the tao. 

The harder one is whether our way of living is in accord with the tao. I would say our way of living flows with the tao about the way that beaver dams flow with a river. Ever since we created agriculture and then built cities, stopped following game animals and moving with the change of seasons, we have in a way been resisting that natural and instinctual aspect of our animal bodies, of our evolutionary path that led us to develop complex brains that we use to overthink everything, for good and for ill. 

Is it natural for a domesticated animal to be kept as a pet? 

We are a composite of many different aspects, some of which contradicts each other, some of which are paradoxical. So we are never fully at rest, completely balanced, because our pieces don't all fit in the same puzzle. No matter how you try to seek out a perfect harmony, something will be off kilter. 

You might decide that for you, the tao means abandoning society and returning to a primitive state of living in the natural wilds. You'll find that to require a great deal of struggle.

 You might decide that the development of human intellect and modern societies make it necessary for you to acquire certain things, which require you to put great time and effort into things that you do not care about or feel any connection with, like studying geometry or getting an unfulfilling job.

1kmwtgc,msdvn8n,t3_1kmwtgc,P_S_Lumapac,"I have dissociation problems too. Daoism doesn't really change it, but it helps with the confusion on the more philosophical side. For instance, sometimes derealisation ends but you still wonder if it might actually be true - and it does seem like if you can cement your view that it's true, the episodes will happen less or pass quicker. For me it's interesting to think about parts of my life that are in line with the dao and parts that aren't - and derealisation seems to occur more when I'm doing parts that aren't in line.

That is, if I'm looking after my family or doing my passionate work, then I never get derealisation. These things are in line with the dao. Maybe derealisation is simply an over reaction to being against the dao? Outside of daoism, this makes a bit of sense - sitting on social media for literal hours of caveman brain hunting and fornicating time, is basically choosing to leave reality for a few hours. There's no analogy your instincts can draw between what they feel the world is like and what you are currently seeing - except maybe porn addiction. In this really basic reading of the dao, a lot of what we do really is going against our human nature, so it's no surprise we get negative mental health issues as a result.

But depersonalisation, yeah I dunno. I get that too and I have tried everything. I am at the point where I recognise it as what it is and try to just ride it out - like recognising you're having a nightmare part way through. It helps, but doesn't stop it.

I will say, through treatment and meditation, I traded a lot of the debilitating side of depression and anxiety for a raise in dissociation. Dissociation sounds far more dramatic, but it's a trade I would make again for the most part.

First, there's the question of using the language 'romantic partner'. I find it bizarre that you'd use this term for someone you've been married to for 12 years. ""Romance""? That sounds like eros to me, which I find hard to believe anyone expects to last more than a few years at most. What you want is a partner who is a deep friend and whom you work with to find a place in the world. You don't mention if you have children, but as a man I just expect that the person a woman really loves isn't her man--it's her child. 

Second, there's the whole question of 'not finding her attractive'. It seems kinda childish for a grown man at your age to be thinking about physical attraction. I'm always amazed when people talk about physical attraction in terms of love and relationships. It just seems so shallow. Love and lust are totally different and should never be associated with each other.

Please don't take this as an attack. Perhaps there's some other reason for your dissatisfaction beyond the 'not finding her attractive' thing. I can certainly get that it might be irritating that she wants to spend so much time on her family. Is there something else that you can't articulate well so you are falling into old cliches? (I think this happens a lot. Sorta like the story of a guy searching for his lost keys under a streetlight 'because the lights better there'.)

As for the 'Daoist thing', I'd just say that part of the Dao of relationships is something popularly called 'the seven year itch' or men having a 'mid-life crisis'. That's when someone gets to a point in life where they can't fool themselves anymore that whatever they are doing is just a temporary stepping-stone to something else that they really want. The desire to reach out for that brass ring before they lose any possibility of getting it can be really strong. Sometimes it is the right thing to reach out and move on. Sometimes, however, it is a total disaster and people spend the rest of their lives unhappy because they threw away something very worthwhile for a poorly-thought-out, ridiculous fantasy.

Whenever I get annoyed with my significant other (which doesn't happen very often) I remember that Liezi became a realized man not after studying to masters or weird shamans.

There are only causes and their effects/consequences. 

Some consequences may be predicted as likely from their causes, however there are always unanticipated consequences.

In the end, the attitudes and beliefs we use to interpret/measure our decisions and their consequences determine the comfort, or discomfort, that results from the decision we've made. 

In general, we tend to justify in our own mind what we choose to do anyway. 

Perhaps what is being looked for within the OP is support, validation, justification, and/or approval for a decision already made.

While happiness is determined by our inner condition of being regardless of external circumstances, we often use our reactions to external circumstances to determine our happiness, level of contentment. 

So, if the question is can one be happy/content while in such a relationship? The answer is yes. When we don't rely upon the relationship for our contentment. 

If we still rely upon external circumstances, a relationship in this situation, to provide our contentment, then it is unlikely contentment will result, since we have already measured the relationship as lacking the necessary ingredients for obtaining our contentment.

I don't think the DDJ has any specific advice about this. But this is how I've been thinking about it. 

If you want to stay, you could do more to take care of your own needs. We make ourselves happy, not our partners (or anyone else). For instance when she has family get togethers, if you hate them, go do something else. Also, although we don't find our partners particularly attractive, they have other qualities we were/are attracted to. Can you focus more on those and do they make up for the lesser attractiveness? It tends to be human nature to focus on negatives and sometimes we forget about the whole truth with all the positives too.

If you choose to break up, it's certainly possible to remain friends. I know a couple who are still good friends with an ex and their new partner. They go on trips all together and such.

1kmc0am,msb5qqh,t1_msau400,CloudwalkingOwl,"Yeah. I wrestled with my crappy job for 31 years. But I sought it out because it had a pension and stuck to it because of the security it brought to the rest of my life. Now I'm glad I did because the pension gives me a little more freedom than I would have without it. 

But unfortunately (or fortunately) for a Daoist it really is a matter of 'figuring things out for yourself'.",5,1747245536.0,2
1kmc0am,msgjt9v,t1_msfacss,CloudwalkingOwl,"I think all the people on line talking about Daoism as if it's just about taking it easy, cruising through life with a smile on their faces are missing something that is intrinsic to the whole thing. Life can be really grinding and cruel. The translated literature of Daoism sometimes misses these points. 

I was asked to comment on a book by an Anglican priest who was using a quotation from a Daoist book where it talks about 'remaining whole'. She had interpreted this as meaning psychologically whole, but I did some research and the scholarly opinion was that it was a reference to punishment by amputation. That misread is somewhat emblematic of how modern people can misunderstand what people are talking about. 

I'm re-reading the Liezi right now and two images from it come immediately to mind. 

In one, Confucious sees someone gleaning in a harvested field but who is singing to himself. He goes over and talks to him and finds he's a realized man who has accepted his lot in the world. I grew up in the countryside and know how much gets left behind after harvest. (Probably a lot more now than in ancient times.) *Gleaning is a lot of work for minimal returns.* A modern re-write of the scene would be if Confucious found someone dumpster-diving and singing to himself---only I suspect that would be a lot less work for a lot more in return than gleaning a grain field in ancient times. (When I was a student I at one time so poor that I took to eating the ornamental kale that the city put in planters around the city.)  

There's also another passage where someone looks at Liezi and his wife and realizes that they look haggard from skipping meals. Someone offers him some bags of rice as relief, but he refuses. When a friend asks why, he says something to the effect that he doesn't want to be associated with that particular govt official. Shortly afterwards the official gets purged, and anyone associated with him suffers 'guilt by association'. The implication is Liezi 'dodged a bullet' by refusing the help. 

The point isn't that Daoism allows you to slide through life without bad things happening, it's that when bad things happen it gives you the insight that allows you to minimize the harm and also to not internalize it. It also allows you to understand what is really important and what is not worth fussing over.  

This gets to the next point. Daoism doesn't just teach people how to do without, it also exposes people to an entire universe of meaning that the vast majority of people don't even know exists. I'm not talking about immortal beings playing chess on mountain tops. *That's all a metaphor.* I mean the immediate beauty that surrounds us but most folks don't see because they are inward focused on their immediate problems. 

There's a Zen story about a traveling monk who is sitting out viewing the moon one night who gets held-up by a thief. The thief goes through the monk's possessions and learns to his chagrin that if anything the monk is poorer than him. Crestfallen, he slinks away feeling miserable. The monk sighs and says to himself ""If I could, I would have given him this moon"". 

This is what sustained me at my job for years. The most irritating parts of it were the 'Dominant Paradigm' (DP) people I worked for and with. They were always complaining about not making enough money and bragging about their material possessions. They said they were bored stiff all the time. I loathed the stupid ways our bosses held onto every scrap of authority they could, even though they often made really dumb mistakes simply because they were too proud to ask anyone underneath them what they thought. 

I got angry, I ground my teeth, but other times I thought to myself ""these people are teaching me lessons about how to forbear adversity and what is and isn't important"", and that would sustain me a little while later. Eventually I learned that my anger and frustration weren't going to ever end, but that they were transitory.  When I remember this, they just become waves that ebb and flow over my life.    

My belief is these are the sorts of lessons that Liezi learned from helping his wife and taking care of the pigs on his farm.",2,1747321210.0,2

By the time I finish my wife comes home, we eat and do the dishes. It's already 8.30. She wants to have a walk or spend time together because we haven't seen each other already.

Firstly awareness of myself, my ego, my emotions. Doing the work to whittle away the insecurities and identify my true self, my nature. Once I was reasonably confident I knew my nature (work ongoing) I was able to see what didn't fit. The things I had to strive at, the things that weren't effortless and didn't bring me peace. Recognising those things, I had to accept that there would be suffering in shedding them. Not just for me but for others. I had to find a way to minimise this and not focus primarily on me, and my needs and wants. Not to cling to any particular outcome too firmly. This allowed me to be more flexible and open in my communication, less reactive, more compassionate. Acceptance is definitely key, it's not all gonna be great. You're going to suffer.

Finally I think the single biggest help for me was just the overwhelming feeling that I was doing the right thing. I feel like I'm living my life the way it was meant to be lived.

Schedule a block of time to do something you enjoy.

The myriad living things do not come to life without it and the hundreds of affairs are not completed without it. Its greatness is such that it embraces all life without partiality. Its beneficence reaches to the tiny insects, but does not seek to be repaid. Its richness sustains all beneath the heavens and never ceases. Its bounty (德) extends to the people, and yet there is no wastage or depletion … It gives to the myriad living things, and yet places none first or last, thus it is without considerations of private or public interest … This is called the **highest De**.

Laozi 8 - \[without mentioning De\]

上善若水。水善利萬物而不爭，處衆人之所惡，故幾於道

For example, some of water's Te are: seeking the lowest point, retreating rather than holding fast and resisting, and patience and persistence as reflected in water's action of wearing away hard substances, such as rock, slowly over time.

    Records on the First Month of the Spring Season 
    
    2. The Nature of Life 
    
    Everything in the world is created by Heaven, then 
    raised by human beings. The one who knows how to act in 
    accordance with the nature of life and will not do anything to 
    damage it is addressed as the Son of Heaven. All actions 
    taken by the Son of Heaven are aimed at safeguarding the 
    lives of his people and complying with the nature of life. That 
    is why officials are appointed. They too are appointed to 
    comply with the nature of life. However, nowadays muddle- 
    headed sovereigns have appointed many officials, but that 
    only resulted in damage to the nature of life. Thus the 
    meaning and original purpose of their appointments are totally 
    lost. Similarly, troops are trained to defend their state when 
    it is threatened by foreign aggression. However, at the 
    present time, troops are trained for internal conflicts— 
    therefore, the meaning and original purpose of their training 
    and setting up are also totally lost. 
    
    According to the nature of water, it is crystal-clear. 
    Nevertheless, it cannot be clear while earth is poured into it. 
    According to the human nature, man can enjoy a long 
    lifespan. Nevertheless, longevity is not possible because life 
    is disturbed with too many external factors. Materials are 
    things used for maintaining the nature of life. Therefore, 
    they should not be considered as the purpose of life at all.
     
    However, less spiritual people of the contemporary era might 
    devote their lives to the search for material interests. Hence, 
    they do not know how to differentiate the essentials from the 
    necessities of life, so that things they consider to be 
    important might in fact be of no value. On the other hand, 
    those really important and valuable things are overlooked. As 
    a result, every action taken by these people is doomed to fail. 
    If a sovereign acts this way, he is absurd. If a court official 
    acts this way, he will offend the sovereign. And if a son acts 
    this way, he is unbearably impertinent. 
    When one of these three problems occurs in a state, it is sure to die out.

My teacher probably most of the time.

He's in his 70s and from a totally different era. He's also had the resources to dedicate his whole life to Taoism and tai chi. He's basically always doing what he wants at any given moment because he has, over time, done the internal (state of mind) and external (people and things in your life) work for things to always be in a balanced state. He just kind of flows from one activity to the next. One of his senior students even wrote a book about it (Flowing the Tai Chi Way).

For me it's about creating systems, routines, rituals, and habits to make life go smoothly while also doing the ""inner"" (in quotes because there kind of isn't an inner or outer, but it's a useful distinction).

These would be things like getting up to an alarm and doing an exact length of certain exercises each day etc. 

Organic systems and habits are ones that come about naturally and fit with our nature and situations. So e.g. we might find there's a natural time to get up without an alarm. Then we may find we generally want a little stretch in the early morning, but not feel any real need to exercise. Then maybe later when we have high energy and are wide awake, we might want to do something more vigorous.

Tea ceremony is a good example. It's a contained space to practice ""Flow"". Music, arts, sports, gardening, reading, writing, etc. are good places to practice ""Flow"". It's so much easier in contained spaces because the rules and skills needed are clear.

Life is basically the opposite of that. lol This is where you need to figure out the ""rules"" and necessary skills for the different activities you flow into and out of.

You just have to keep trying things, reflecting, adjusting, trying things again, etc.

Think about how long it takes to get a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Even for someone who's naturally inclined to sports. Years and years and years. This is an activity with clear rules and processes.

To have somewhat consistent Flow or experiencing ""wuwei"" requires a black belt in a bunch of different disciplines and figuring out what they are and how to do it isn't easy. Especially because as you grow you'll have to drop skills and pick up new ones.

Knowing that you'll never have a black belt in life that will last forever is a part of what's needed to be able to stay closer to Flow.

If you want to feel Flow regularly that means you need expertise in a lot of different domains.

One way to make it less complicated is by simplifying your life, and this is why a lot of people do that. I do it as well.

Even the process of simplification can be complex depending on where you are when you start.

Just think about two different people.

One lives in the mountains, hunts and grows their own food, collects rainwater to drink, makes their own clothes, and spends their free time doing hobbies enjoyable to them.

Regularly staying in or close to Flow will be simple and easy 

The other person is a part-time worker at Walmart, has two kids, money is always tight, plays video games (note: something I love to do!), and is overweight.

They might only experience that Flow feeling while gaming. In order to feel Flow more consistently they might need to get disciplined about money, start exercising, play video games less, invest time in learning to find ways to make more money, etc.

The path to feel regular Flow for them is more complex.

On top of all of this, people have traumas to unpack, bath relationships to mend, mental health challenges (like ADHD, or bipolar disorder, I have the second one, etc.)

There's not enough information about what you're worrying about to give you any sort of useful answer. It's often the case that mental illness or neurodivergence causes similar issues.

Looking at the DDJ and Zhuangzi, the closest teachings to this would be about your competence level and whether you are going beyond your role. If you become more competent you won't worry about completing in time, and if you limit yourself to your role you won't worry about anything outside that role.

Suppose your issue is you're a student who needs to study for an exam and also needs to feel loved by being social during the same period. While you're having fun, you will be worried about your need to study, and while you're studying, you will worry about your social life. Accepting that your role is a student is a simple way to address this so you can study without worry, but you might also raise your competence in studying so that you have plenty of time for relaxation with friends.

The qi builds and reaches a level/quality where it has its own intelligence. The releasing of tensions opens the system for qi to play out through us. So as the energy builds and resistance to its flow diminishes, we gradually move into a more natural state of flow. Part of this is also that the qi pushes out into the world around us, and so we connect our energy with the energy of the world unfolding around us, and so we flow naturally with it.

OP talks about anxiety standing in his way, for example. It's all a matter of what the mind currently trusts most. If the mind trusts striving and planning to keep it safe, it will default to anxiety to solve a problem. The sage has put complete trust in the unencumbered mind, so it defaults to that in order to solve problems. That's wu wei.

To arrive at that level of trust, a person has to actually try out the non-striving, non-planning mind in the face of adversity and see how much better it fares first-hand. I see most Taoist texts as simple encouragement, like, ""hey, have you tried just giving up completely and letting things play out as they will? You'll feel so much better and everything will be so easy to manage because you feel so free. It's like you're doing nothing at all!""

Put another way, if OP wants to experience wu wei instead of anxiety, they just need to let their mind go to the places that feel reckless. It feels reckless to stop listening to anxious thoughts. It feel like abandoning responsibilities or throwing yourself to the wolves. It feels wrong to abandon effort when every part of your mind is screaming at you to take control--like letting go of the steering wheel on the freeway. You can be the one to do it, though. You don't have to completely lose track of yourself. It's really just a decision you make. Like, ""oh, I can just give up on this. I can just drop *everything* can't I?""

Be free from cares to be carefree. Drop everything to be unencumbered. It's a choice, not a mystery, not esoteric, not a paradox. It's just a choice we absolutely don't want to make, so it seems paradoxical that it would have such good results and feel so wonderful.",3,1746950824.0,1

Children are a wonderful example of why I make such a statement. Children learn a lot from watching others sure but I know many children climb trees that have never seen someone climb a tree before. Children typically start to talk before their brains are developed enough to understand the practical use of speech. Sure children can see others walking but they don't get taught the necessary things like controlling balance, how to push off the ground effectively. All the things which become natural had to be learned. Learning can come from many places not just a teacher. Knowledge doesn't even necessarily need a source. Example do you know why the sky is blue? The sky is blue do to refraction with the water dispersing the light across the atmosphere. Not exactly something that can be taught. When we speak of teaching you do realize that requires a first learner right? I mean the Chuang Tzu's butchers teacher had to learn somehow. Whether that be learning on their own or having a teacher. However if you go far enough back everything taught and learned had to be learned before it could be taught. This is Wu Wei, intuition of when to act even if that act is stillness. 


Mental non-interference like wtf are you saying lil bro. When practicing meditation your supposed to be present and observe without judgement. Wu Wei your supposed to rely on your Te intuition to guide your actions neither of those have anything to do with ""mental interference"" in fact mental interference is something we are supposed to accept during meditation.

Sure there are established methods of learning to be a boxer and to be frank any of those listed are great to learn an established method but what about the creators? Did they have a consistent, persistent and efficient training method? Second do you think the easy way is the way you should follow?


I knew a guy who was born without hands in highschool. They could easily knock your lights out with a ""punch"" yet they didn't have anything past their wrist. So if fisticuffs can be done without fists and they had to learn how to hit with their own ""hands"". They used to tell me about how they had to change how they impacted, changed the way they have to hold their arms. The efficient and established methods are great but by no means necessary. 


Stop imposing our emotions to reach automatic action that is probably the funniest line in your whole comment. So your saying you never subconsciously popped a boner, never seen anyone act automatically in anger, never heard the sadness of an employee spouting welcome to xyz may I take your order? In several cases we act without thinking because of emotions; in fact temporary insanity pleas in court are based on that foundation. The foundation that somethings can be so bad that we cannot hold a person reasonably sane for the time of the event simply because of how crazy the emotions were. Yet to you emotions get in the way of the ability to act without thought? I mean I can cook and clean without feeling any way about it but I can also walk down the road and absolutely hate it. Does that mean cooking and cleaning are automatic? Does this mean that walking isn't?",1,1747047220.0,5

All of this is self-evident once we reflect upon our own real life experiences. 

Any skill practiced enough and long enough will eventually begin to occur on its own without our mental interference. 

This includes walking, eating, brushing our teeth, driving, riding a bicycle, experienced musicians see this with their play and advanced athletes with their athletic performance. 

Our biggest interference occurs when we impose an emotional imperative to perform well upon ourselves before the skill has been effectively developed.

This quote in particular - 

“Tao sits at the root of the Taoist universe. Though it’s often translated as “way”, there’s no English equivalent—even in Chinese it has a variety of meanings. For now, it’s best to let this word sit vacuous, devoid of a referent. Better to infer its meaning through exposure.”",3,1746974524.0,0

There's more on this, and daoism generally, here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXNDO3lgt18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXNDO3lgt18)",2,1746941834.0,0
1kjt5ii,mrpsi1m,t3_1kjt5ii,Iboven,"""Naming"" something is defining it or objectifying it. A name has opinions attached to it. People can understand the Tao, but when you start to define it and draw lines around it it's no longer the actual Tao, it's just conversations about it with opinions and lines. I think the first verse is saying, ""This book is about the Tao, but it's not the actual Tao."" Like a statement of humility, or a disclaimer.

In terms of emptying your mind, I'm assuming you're talking about verse 3? There aren't any lines about emptying the mind in the first verse. 

I think the idea at the heart of Taoism is fairly simple. The sage lets go of direct control over the world and puts their faith in the relaxed and unencumbered mind to accomplish what needs to be done. The ""thing"" the sage has faith in is the Tao. ""Tao"" can be a placeholder for fate, or luck, or unconscious mind, or natural conditioning, or instinct, etc.

Basically, look at your mind, identify all forms of striving, trying, doing, planning, etc. and give up on it. See what happens. It can feel reckless or wrong to do that, but the result is wu wei, or action without effort. The sage is ""carefree,"" as in, they have no cares or worries. This is a decision they make because they trust that unencumbered mind to steer their life better than the striving mind can. Being unencumbered isn't a result of the practice, it is the practice itself. It's abandonment of responsibility and the sense of importance.

Put another way, if you are perfectly at ease, content, and happy, you will be the best decision maker you can be, you will be the best friend you can be, and everything you do will feel easy because you don't have to push for it. It can feel very backwards, but by removing all effort, you become a more effective person. The sage has seen this first hand enough times to put their full faith in it, and they have emptied out their mind of all striving. This is the ""way"" they are following.",1,1746949261.0,0

We can talk about it, but the point is that nothing you can say about it is correct.  And when we think, we think in words.  So the flaw lies there also.

We learn to understand the Tao by emptying our mind of thoughts, observing, embracing contradiction, and moving toward what sits between them.  We remember that all words are flawed, but that they come from someone who may simply be using an imperfect tool to communicate something true.  Just like we do.",1,1746998009.0,0

*You* 遊 is a crucial term for understanding the *Zhuangzi*. Translated as “play,” “free play,” and “wandering,” it is usually defined as an ideal, playful Zhuangzian way of being. There are two problems with this definition. The first is logical: the *Zhuangzi* cannot consistently recommend playfulness as an ideal, since doing so vitiates the essence of *you*—it becomes an ethical imperative instead of an activity freely undertaken for its own sake. The second problem is performative: arguments for playful Zhuangzi as exemplar resemble those of the logicians and philosophers who appear to come in for Zhuangzian criticism. This essay addresses these tensions by demonstrating how the *Zhuangzi* ambiguates the nature and value of *you*. Apparent endorsements of *you* are not freestanding, instead occurring in grudging replies of teachers to overly zealous students. In light of this recontextualization, a new version of *you* is offered that accommodates “non-playful” ways of being.

But after the man had gone a couple of hundred paces, he came out of the water and began strolling along the base of the embankment, his hair streaming down, singing a song. Confucius ran after him and said, “At first I thought you were a ghost, but now I see you’re a man. May I ask if you have some special way of staying afloat in the water?”**

>**“I have no way. I began with what I was used to, grew up with my nature, and let things come to completion with fate. I go under with the swirls and come out with the eddies, following along the way the water goes and never thinking about myself. That’s how I can stay afloat.”** 

>**Confucius said, “What do you mean by saying that you began with what you were used to, grew up with your nature, and let things come to completion with fate?”**

**beidou 北 斗 Northern Dipper** 

Since early times, the Northern Dipper (Ursa Major) has played a fundamental role in Chinese official and religious life, due to its importance in the astrocalendrical calculations and its mighty apotropaic powers. The basic features of its roles in Taoism are already apparent in the Han period: in the Shiji (Records of the Historian, j. 27; trans. Chavannes 1895–1905, 3: 339– 43), the Dipper is associated with the pole star as the heavenly center of the world, and is the residence of the Great One (\*Taiyi); its rotation divides the world into the Nine Palaces (\*jiugong). The Dipper, therefore, rules over Heaven and Earth and symbolizes the complex unity of the cosmos. Its earthly counterpart is Mount \*Kunlun, the axis of the world. Within the human body, the Dipper is located in its three centers—at the level of the head, the heart, and the navel—and is related to the Three Ones (\*sanyi). It is also associated with the spleen, the organ related to Soil and the Center in the \*wuxing pattern. Since the color of Soil is yellow, alchemical texts call the Dipper the “yellow star” (huangxing 黃星), and one of its synonyms is Yellow Dame (huangpo 黃 婆). 

However, the Dipper lies in the North and thus symbolizes the Origin, which embraces beginning and end and subsumes both Yin and Yang. Many terms used to describe the Dipper give it the qualities of the Origin and pivot of the universe, and the days of the “return to the Origin” (huiyuan 迴元) are consecrated to it. The Dipper therefore has a double nature: it is linked with life and death and is associated with the idea of passage, and also divides good from evil and grants punishments and rewards. All the symbols that represent the connection between unity and multiplicity are closely related to it. 

The Dipper consists of nine stars, number 9 being that of the Great Yang (taiyang 太陽) and of totality. Four stars are located in the scoop, three in the handle, and two are invisible (see fig. 23). The latter, called Fu 輔 and Bi 弼, are its assistants. Those who can see them, under strict conditions of purity, enjoy a life span of several hundred years. Each star is inhabited by divinities, and encloses a paradise similar to those in the Moon and Sun. According to some texts, the nine stars have counterparts which form another invisible constellation surrounding the first one. These nine supplementary stars illuminate the Dipper; they are the celestial-Yang and earthly-Yin souls (\*hun and po) of the Dipper, and are inhabited by the spouses of its kings. Within the human body, the spirits of these “black stars” reside in the Hall of Light (\*mingtang) located in the brain, and their titles suggest that their function is to protect the embryo. Thus the celestial world appears to be inverted: the female, Yin, and dark entities are outside, while the male, Yang, and luminous ones are within. In fact, the Dipper is said to be “the natural fire contained in the Yin.”

In Taoism, the Dipper has four major roles, all related to its dual aspect. First, the Dipper indicates the proper orientation for performing meditation or rituals through the apparent movement of its “handle.” Second, it has strong exorcistic powers as a divinity of the North and of the underworld. Adepts, for example, cover themselves with its stars by visualizing them descending directly above their heads, or surrounding them. Analogously, in the Thunder Rituals (\*leifa), the thunder is summoned from the direction to which the Dipper points (called the Gate of the Vital Force, \*mingmen) in order to expel demons. Third, the Dipper is the recipient of invocations to ask forgiveness for one's sins and to have one's name erased from the registers of death (siji 死籍). Fourth, it opens the way to heaven (its seventh star is called Tianguan 天關 or Heavenly Pass) in both meditation and ritual.

Therefore, ""what is"" and ""what isn't"" [are used to] gauge creation; ""difficult"" and ""easy"" gauge completion; ""long"" and ""short"" gauge proportion; ""high"" and ""low"" gauge steepness; ""tone"" and ""note"" (or ""rumors"" and ""good repute"") gauge harmony; ""before"" and ""after"" gauge sequence.

1kjir3b,mrn679s,t3_1kjir3b,Lao_Tzoo,"Keep in mind hard/easy, and other measurements, are a mental imposition we impose upon events. 

We fix a  goal within our mind and then assign an emotional value upon achieving this goal. 

Then, whenever we measure our performance with imposed emotional value against the goal and find ourselves falling short of the goal, we experience displeasure expressed as unhappiness, frustration, anger, etc. 

The idea is to develop the mental skill of setting a goal, or purpose, absent our imposition of emotional attachment to the outcome. 

That is, deciding we emotionally ""need"" the outcome we wish before we allow ourselves to be content. 

Think of it this way, 

A river doesn't ""try"" to flow to the Sea. It merely follows its natural course, its path, and allows the outcome to be what the outcome becomes. 

In the same way, there is a certain process for humans achieving a decided upon goal. 

It is a pattern of practicing the required skills that are necessary in order to obtain that goal. 

When we apply ourselves to the skill practice, keeping the end goal in mind, but absent mental and emotional interference, or insisting upon our specified outcome, we allow the skill practice process to work for us unobstructed by our mental interference, and the outcome occurs naturally, as a consequence of the process. 

This is learning to stop interfering with Tao's naturally occurring process and centering ourselves within ourselves while allowing outward processes to flow on their own.",1,1746908812.0,0

>**天下皆知美之为美 When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,**

>**皆知善之为善 When all know good as good,** 

>**斯不善矣 There is the not good.**

>**高下相傾 High and low depend on one another;** 

>**音声相和 Music and voice harmonize one another;** 

>**前後相随 Front and rear follow one another:** 

>**恒也 These are constant.** 

>**是以 That is why** 

>**圣人处无为之事 The sage handles affairs by Non-doing (wuwei),**

>**行不言之教 And practices teaching by not speaking.** 

>**万物作而弗始 He lets all things happen but does not initiate,** 

>**生而弗有 Lets them grow but does not possess,** 

>**为而弗恃 Gets things done but does not take advantage,** 

>**功成而弗居 Achieves his goal but claims no credit.** 

>**夫唯弗居 Just because he claims no credit,** 

>**是以不去 His credit does not go away.**

>**Commentary:-**

>**In the first stanza Laozi is making a couple of statements that may sound contradictory or even absurd at first. But, upon closer examination, they turn out to be wise discernment of the truths in life. Such statements are paradoxes, and by invoking paradoxes Laozi teaches us how to transcend the differences forged by the human mind and be at peace with Nature’s creations. For example, Nature or Dao created the “ten thousand things under Heaven” without making distinctions between the ugly and the beautiful, the good and the not good. It is only we humans who created such distinctions. It is we humans who crave for the beautiful and good and loathe the ugly and the not good. Such cravings and loathing lead to strife and agony, and that in itself is ugly and not good.** 

>**Following the two paradoxes about beauty and good versus ugliness and not good, Laozi posits one of mankind’s first cracks at relativity—the interdependence of opposites such as Being versus Nonbeing, easy versus difficult, long versus short, and so on. “Music and voice,” by the way, refers to instrumental and vocal music. Then, in one of Laozi’s characteristic sequences, marked by his use of “therefore” and “thus” and “that is why,” he teaches us how to follow the sage’s behavior accordingly. Given the received order of the chapters, this is Laozi’s first mention of his hero 圣人 (shèng rén) or “sage.” To Laozi, the sage is not so much a moral exemplar as someone who is endowed with the wisdom to get things done without any arbitrary or self-serving action. Such a notion of wise “Non-doing” or “not doing,” known as 无为 (wú wéi), is going to become a leitmotif that runs throughout the pages of this book, but here the author seems to throw it out casually as if it was a familiar term, suggesting that he is probably not the first user of the expression. However, Laozi does go on to elaborate what he means by “Non-doing” or “not doing” and clinches the point by a guaranteed reward: “Just because he claims no credit, his credit does not go away.” This closing sentence strongly suggests that Laozi’s philosophy is not just about pure metaphysics or ethics but has the applicative value of gaining the desired result with the least effort.** 

>**A word may be said about “teaching without speaking” or “teaching without words.” Posterity has ridiculed Laozi by citing his work of five thousand words as rebuttal to his own principle. While recognizing the ineffability of Dao as the sage implies, we need not take his words literally and attempt a total denial of the role of words in teaching.(Charles Q.Wu)**",1,1746909195.0,0

1kj3i6d,mrkc498,t3_1kj3i6d,Prize-Actuator-8972,"Sharing my observations.

Much of the modern and Western writing on Eastern practice subjects tends to dilute or distort the original teachings—often reinterpreting them to fit contemporary frameworks or personal philosophies. As a result, key nuances are lost, and the depth of the tradition is compromised. For those who truly wish to understand these systems, it's essential to study the original texts in their native language. While modern Mandarin is helpful, it's important to recognize that many classical texts are written in Classical Chinese, which differs significantly in grammar, vocabulary, and style from the modern vernacular.

It's also worth noting that many of these classical manuscripts were intentionally written in cryptic, symbolic, or riddle-like language. This was a deliberate measure by the masters of the time to guard esoteric knowledge from the uninitiated—much like the veiled language used in Western alchemical texts. Understanding these works requires not just a grasp of Classical Chinese, but also a contextual awareness of the culture, philosophy, and oral traditions in which they were embedded.

With this context, it's easier to understand how modern and Western writers may have misinterpreted or oversimplified the original manuscripts.

Taiji put in easy terms, is advanced qigong with energy cultivation.

4. ""Be like water"" - famous quote by pop culture icon Bruce Lee, who popularized daoist philosophy/spirituality

5. The recent film ""Everything everywhere all at once""

6. Zhuangzi, 4th century philosopher and philosophical texts 

Master Dongguo asked Zhuangzi, “This thing called the Way—where does it exist?”
Zhuangzi, said, “There’s no place it doesn’t exist.”
“Come,” said Master Dongguo, “you must be more specific!”
“It is in the ant.”
“As low a thing as that?”
“It is in the panic grass.”
“But that’s lower still!”
“It is in the tiles and shards.”
“How can it be so low?”
“It is in the piss and shit!”

Personally I have a deep gratitude for qigong, I practiced yoga for many years and still do which also brought practices and philosophies into my life that have deeply helped me, but in a time I found myself in a kind of existential crises where it wasn't able to help me with my anxiety, qigong's different approach to energy helped me achieve more ballance. 
(This is absolutely in no way a diss on yoga, or saying one is better or worse, both are vast groups of systems with huge history, internal variety and incredible merit. Some things are somewhat similar or mirrored in them in ways that seem subtle and profound, and it is in a way the differences that have helped me greatly)

For headaches even some of the simplest qigong moving and breathing forms have helped me.

Edit: may sound random but adding to the list of hits cuz I was reminded of this - healthy non bound feet for Chinese women. Daoist priestesses did not bind their feet when this fortunately outdated practice still took place in China, and were sometimes mocked for this.",3,1746919080.0,0
1kjl8ax,mrozjom,t3_1kjl8ax,OldDog47,"To me, the great lesson of Dao is how to view life and live life in a way that allows me to be at peace and harmony with the course of living. I've come to see the meaning and purpose of life is simply to live it. 

In order to do that, one needs to develop a degree of selflessness ... to consider others before oneself. There is no end to and no satisfying the self-centered desires that the mind can manufacture.  If all of one's time and effort is consumed chasing selfish desires, there will be no peace and harmony with the course of living.

Is Dao the answer? I think it can be if approached in the right manner. In certain Daoist meditation approaches, the first step is to believe. That is, have faith that there is something to it, even though not readily apparent. Such a faith allows one to move on to the next step. It is the initial inspiration that draws one into the practice. It is not really a rational thing ... more of an intuitive feeling. 

Undertaking the journey with Dao requires a bit of a leap of faith. As already pointed out, it is not a goal but a process ... an ongoing process. Repeated readings of the classic texts ... Laozi, Zhuangzi,  Liezi and others, by different translators ... over time, teaches one to see life and being differently. 

Just a few thoughts. Hope you can find them helpful.

~~~~~~~~~
I once got some flak from orthodox Taoists who became very irate that my version of the “Tao Te Ching” was not a translation, that I would take off at certain points and throw the original out the window and do variations on the original theme. It wasn’t a translation, so I had that privilege, I felt. But this did not make them happy.

He made it in four months with no knowledge of the source language, heavily paraphrasing and even inventing (and deleting) much of the content. Mitchell's version is a major source of confusion and misquotes regarding what Lao Tzu supposedly tried to state.",7,1746820483.0,0

It was also the first version that I read, and I still like it very much. That being said it will be important as you go on to read other versions too. As it’s critics, say, it definitely takes a westernized and somewhat informal approach. I think that makes it more accessible for people at least at the start.

The good news is there’s no reason you have to pick one over another. There are dozens of them. I’ve found value in most of them. Here’s a link to dozens of different translations. Try them out and see which ones you like best. I rarely talk about an issue without looking at more than just one translation.

I have sence moved on to other versions of the TTC and interpretations.

The ""naming"" is not merely about giving something a name, but it's all about a more fundamental cognitive function: categorization. We perceive things and conceptualize them through abstract concepts. Thus, we put them into their respective ""boxes"". By the very nature of this process, it creates the distinction between what is in a concept and what is outside. No concept can fully capture the variance of perceptual sensations, perspectives, etc. Reality is always richer than the concepts we use to think about describe it with.

So, any conceptualization of Dao is inherently missing (or, makes us blind) something from it.

Once the river has been crossed over, the raft is of no more use, and should be discarded.

Enso Circle: Letting go of the mind

by The Editorial Team

 

 August 29, 2023

According to Japanese, as we search to find meaning and purposes in our lives, certain concepts and symbols can help us. One of the most effective symbols is the Enso Circle, a Japanese “circle” that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes and used in Zen to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create.

The Ensō circle represents our true and innermost self. The Enso circle, which can be open or closed, symbolizes an expression of life, showing both the beginning and end. It’s also used to express absolute enlightenment, strength, elegance, the universe and the wuji (the void).

The Enso is a popular symbol of Buddhism and Japanese calligraphy that is made with a single brushstroke that creates an unclosed circle. It’s also called the Infinity Circle, Japanese Circle, Zen Circle or the Circle of Enlightenment.

In essence, it exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese wabi-sabi perspective and aesthetic:

Fukinsei (asymmetry, irregularity)

Kanso (simplicity)

Koko (basic; weathered)

Shizen (without pretense; natural)

Yugen (subtly profound grace)

Datsuzoku (freedom)

Seijaku (tranquility)

 Regaining a spiritual and mental balance

The goal of this circle is to free the mind from thoughts of anger and fear. This freedom from paradoxical mindfulness can improve well-being as well as help you to enter a state of flow.

The point of it is deeply personal. Represents a spiritual and mental balance more than anything else. Depending on the artist’s intentions, you will encounter Ensō Circles left slightly open or entirely closed.

There are many different meanings about the Enso. According to many people, the white circle can indicate emptiness, or it can take on the idea that it contains all it needs within its center. On a social level, the Enso circle can be seen to symbolize harmonious cooperation between one another.

Furthermore, maybe the circle illustrates the cyclic nature of life: birth, death, and rebirth. Even seasons go through this cyclic process.

In meditation, the Enso indicates the perfect meditative state in which your mind is detached from all and in connection with the infinite. It provides a sense of calm, concentration, and rejuvenation.

1ki84ii,mrl9ahh,t1_mrivprr,berf,"Tao (or Dao) is a chinese character (word) that translates many ways.  The simplest is way.  It can mean path but also (metaphorically) a way of doing things.  There are as many daos as there are things to do and people to woof about how to do them.  The same Chinese character can serve as either a noun or a verb (and does in the first line of the Daodejing, where it occurs 3 times, 2 as noun, 1 as verb).  As a verb it means serve as a path or way of doing things or as a guide.  Unlike English, there is no marker of singular or plural, so you don't know whether to translate as way or ways (or method or methods or whatever) and there is no notion of count nouns or mass nouns (so you don't know whether to say the dao or just dao, maybe it is a mass noun like water, you just say there is water in the glass, not the water).  So the translation if we take ""dao"" as more or less untranslatable is dao [that] can dao is not unchanging dao.  Now you apply all of that uncertainty about what dao can mean here.  So maybe ways that are useful are not unchangeable ways.  Or methodology that is useful cannot be unchanging.  But nothing mystical was originally intended.  That is all western nonsense.  There was a serious philosophical point in the debates in ancient China.  This disagrees with Confucious and other ancient Chinese philosophers.

I also recall Hansen writing somewhere that he agreed with Guo Xiang's position of rejecting a singular metaphysical Dao, though sadly, I don't remember the source.

I'm changing the subject a little, but this is what Brook Ziporyn had to say about Guo Xiang's interpretation of Dao (which he translates as ""Course"") amongst other things:-

>**GUO XIANG (252–312). Responsible for editing the original fifty-five chapter version of the Zhuangzi down to the current thirty-three chapter version, Guo Xiang is also the most influential of all its commentators, his work later being treated as the de facto “official” commentary when the text came to be recognized as canonical in imperial collections. His commentary is based closely on Xiang Xiu’s lost work, to the point of raising suspicions of plagiarism. All later commentators may be assumed to have studied Guo’s commentary closely. Guo’s staunchly anti-metaphysical, antifoundationalist, and anti-theistic interpretation of Zhuangzi rejects any notion of the Course as creator or source of beings, and with it any ontological hierarchy between Heaven and Man or between the Course and things. Instead, he stresses the concept of spontaneity, or “self-so,” (ziran, ) reading Zhuangzi’s Course as literally nonbeing, so that claims of the Course’s creation of things are to be understood as meaning that nothing interferes with the self-so self-creation, and also intrinsic rightness, of each individual thing. “Self-so” is the antonym of deliberate activity and of the purposive knowledge that goes with it. All deliberate activity, in Guo’s view, is based on the “traces” left by one particular self-so event on another, which come to inspire conscious esteem and emulation, thereby interfering with the self-so process that functions in the absence of cognitions, ideals, explicit values, and deliberate endeavors. Guo often interprets against the grain of the surface meaning of the Zhuangzi text, particularly when it is satirical or critical of Confucian sages or when it seems to advocate withdrawal from active involvement in the world of affairs. For Guo, the critiques in the text are merely of the sages’ “traces,” not of the sages themselves, who were themselves perfectly merged into their own self-so and thus perfectly right in all their deeds, but who thereby unfortunately, through no fault of their own, came to be valued and emulated by later people, thereby undermining and disturbing the self-so rightness of these misguided admirers. Guo’s expositions on the theme of the self-so, and his uncompromising relativism, remain unsurpassed among Zhuangzi’s commentators.**",1,1746975085.0,7

1ki8rfn,mrla3wd,t3_1ki8rfn,deleted,"A pleasing exercise that may or may not be in the spirit of the Dao De Ching is to think about the connotations of words. How do those words make you feel. What are the genre associations with each word? Do you rank them in some way? Do some make you feel more judged, or are some more friendly? 

With words like ""God"", especially for someone of a religious nature in the west, that word may have very important connotations -- either institutionally or else in terms of emotional ones. This may depend on whether they were raised to feel one way or the other about religion itself, even. Consider how many words exist for something like ""the universal spirit that gives life to the world"". How one feels about each word for this in each language might depend entirely on their relationship to the religious community (or their idea of it) in their own society. 

When reading the Dao De Ching, I get the idea that one is maybe supposed to consider weighing what words mean in their mind beyond the literal conversational value they have for communicating a well defined idea amongst people who don't think together (and thus must rely on definitions commonly agreed upon, unless they are of a mind on subtext somehow). Considering what words mean in their mind, are there things you can't express about them in words very easily? Are there feelings and ways of connection that don't have an easy definition in words, altho you can imagine how they feel in the tactile or graphical sense? Are there things beyond even that which you don't have a name for? Reading such a book in English, twice or thrice translated from an ancient language, one almost has to do that anyways -- how much neater that the fellow may have been interested in that idea himself, unless I have projected it on him from afar. 

Anyways, ""God"" is a super loaded word that may carry connotations that are very hard to describe in any language. These connotations may have a ""feel"" that is hard to give any other word to. For others, perhaps they feel that no such word can every carry the connotations they imagine when they deeply reflect on their benevolent spirit(s), or that none can do them justice. For others still, perhaps the exercise is to consider the connotations of a word, how those connection change over time and lead to other words, and how they are similar to the feelings evokes by non-verbal reality; and thus hone in on what does not change over time: the feeling identified, rather than the word which was linked to it. All of those things are valuable and practiced by both some Daoists and some Buddhists.

which speaks volumes about the religious person and less abouth the atheist.

Some need the idea of punishment to stay ""nice.""

Kinda like the laws we made and the prison system.

I'm unsure how familiar you are with Oriental Internal Arts (Neigong) 

I'm still a student in neigong but will try to provide my understanding:
- Meditation to develop self-awareness, focus & concentration.
- Breathing exercises to develop lungs & diaphragm. 
- Qigong primary focus on qi circulation.
- Taiji is advanced qigong, with addition to converting qi to energy for combat.
- Traditional 8 Limbs of Ashtanga Yoga from Yoga Sutras is best in purifying qi & aid awareness of shen.
- Neidansu is a very obscure art, to convert jing & foreign qi to primordial qi to nourish the shen. 
- Conditioning exercises such as yijingjing is meant to recondition the physical body to be more compatible with internal development.

This may not be an accurate definition but a personal one:
- Qi is primarily vitality, make up of both Ying & Yang. Human body can catalyst small amounts of qi from food, water, herbs, air & energies to nourish Shen.
- Jing is condensed essence made from Qi for reproduction. 
- Shen is supposedly Spirit that determines your well being. The richer your Shen, the better is your wellbeing overall. More physically energised, more youthful & healthy.

It’s def NOT as simple as high T equals good yang energy, it’s more about overall balance and not having a deficiency. 

I’ve experimented over the years and you can def get a feel for it. But for example I once was feeling low yang during a very stressful time in my life. Intuition said I should get a blood test and it turned out my T levels were low at the time as well as B12. So other vitamin deficiencies could be related. In that case, the doctor had me do several rounds of B12 shots and it made my T levels go way up as well. I do wonder though if that all happened initially solely because of stress or my body pushing back on years of T boosting experiments with supplements and periods of retention.

When lifting to failure, we must allow for proper recovery. 

If we don't, the body doesn't adapt properly and fatigue builds upon fatigue and in merely a few days we will feel that fatigue as a reduction in Yang energy.

1kh2vbx,mrl3vxc,t1_mr3wghu,az4th,"Yang is spirit, shen. 

Find something that makes you feel alive, gives you purpose. Something that feels real, a part of your destiny, something that is uniquely you. Something that helps you return to oneness of all things. This comes of harmonizing with all, and dissolving division as an illusion, seeing beyond the mundane and reconnecting with the true. 

That's what begins to connect you back to your spirit. And then helps spirit to gather within you. 

But it is really you, gathering yourself, back to connection with all, as you leave behind your divisions.

We can't have energy if we separate ourselves from it. 

Sure, there are yang kinds of things. Vitamin D, iodine, caffeine. But they will metabolize the yang out of our reserves, and leave us with less capacity (yin) to contain the energy (yang). Our quality of sleep goes down as our yin can no longer contain our yang, and we quickly age. 

Reversing this, we clear out, create more healthy capacity within us, let our minds go, stop sexual waste, and learn to use our vitality to circulate creative energy within us, before it tries to leak out into sexual activity. These days so many people either waste their vitality with sexual addictions, or do the opposite and try to store it up without metabolizing it in beneficial ways. By three months of storing, people go back to the other extreme unless they have found a way to utilize the creative energy. Tai Chi, meditation, physical activity can all help with this. 

But then too, whenever we are metabolizing our vitality (jing) up, we never want to deplete it. That is our water. We want to circulate it and nourish it, and use it, but not to the point of depletion. If one is already wasting it with sexual habits, and then working themselves out to the point of depletion, and doing nothing meaningful to their cultivate their spirit and their soul, then where is the life in that? Cultivate your life in a meaningful way, and keep holding on to that meaning, holding on to unity with all without division, letting it awaken your compassion and your heart, which then raises your vibration.

That is, our training is too hard, or too frequent, for our recovery ability. 

This means more rest, protein and sleep is necessary, or all we will do is feel drained, as if our Yang energy is diminishing.

Proper training requires a balance between effort and recovery. This takes practice and paying attention in order to get the most optimal balance between the two.

I do rings workout 4x per week. Per day, it is around 20 minutes in total plus 10 minutes for recovery and stretching. But I do not want to be competitive so for me its more to have a good form and healthy, strong body.
I used to go to gym and spend 1h-1:30h but with rings, the results are actually better because I can be more efficient. Ive also had no injuries in the past 3 years related to that.

1kg49rc,mqvrx6l,t3_1kg49rc,Lao_Tzoo,"As an agreement and confirmation, here is a type of meditation I've recommended for perhaps 20 years or so, and on Reddit many times in the past 5 years or so:

""As with many things in life there are many methods. Different ones work better for different people according to their personality, inclinations, and natural talents. My favorite is a variation of counting breaths.

I don't like counting breaths because it involves discursive thought, that is, concentrating with words and we want to transcend words, and it also involves meeting a goal, that is, counting. 

People then worry about counting and losing count and wandering mind while counting etc. Then they waste energy worrying about whether they are doing it correctly or not. 

What I have come up with is what I call rhythmic breathing.

Sit comfortably, or lay down. Comfort is the goal. You will inhale and exhale through the nose. Inhale deeply using abdominal breathing or yogic complete breathing. It doesn't matter which, as long as you can breath deeply.

Inhale deeply to your comfort level. Hold the breath to your comfort level. Exhale to your comfort level. Hold the exhalation to your comfort level. Then inhale again and continue. This forms a natural rhythm of your own. 

There is no set time or rhythm. It is entirely up to you. Each breath/hold cycle will vary from one cycle to the other. That is okay. It doesn't matter. It's your rhythm. 

The only goal is to not consciously set a goal/pattern and be comfortable. If you need an extra deep breath, take it. If it is comfortable to hold longer this time than last time, fine. 

Think of each breath cycle as similar to waves on the beach. Inhale wave comes in, pause, exhale wave goes out, pause, etc. Sometimes I'll even visualize waves on the beach.

The waves at the beach have their own rhythm, but it is a variable rhythm. It is rhythmic, but always changing, just like your breath. 

You will find your breathing sounds like waves at the beach as well. As you exhale feel the mental tension go out with the waves.

Then just relax, feel and enjoy your own natural rhythm.""",79,1746538596.0,0

From India to China, all over the world, mystics talk about the breath. Whenever there's a meditative tradition, mystical tradition--breath is always one of the loftiest objects, if not the loftiest one. 

It's funny because it happened to me too personally, as well as some other friends of contemplative traditions, that at some point, breath starts to ""click"". It's kind of like ""How did I miss it all along?!"" kind of feeling, which I think you've gone through as well. 

I've tried to find literature on breath, and from Zen to Tao, there wasn't much of an inspirational or educational ""literature"" on breath. There's no shortage of words and things written about breath, don't get me wrong, but I think what makes breath ""click"" as an object of meditation, is not so easy to put into words.

Wuwei is not ""non-action."" It's a state of being. Similar to being so adept at a skill that you're not consciously aware that you're doing it. Like when you drive to work, but then don't remember how you got there.

So it's not about eliminating everything but breath awareness when trying to meditate. It's about becoming so adept in all the aspects of meditation that you forget you're doing them. As I understand it, there are 4 main points to meditation:

Alignment: This is primarily concerned with skeletal alignments while sitting or standing so that you are properly aligned with gravity. Here you feel an upward pull on the bai hui point. The focus is on your bones basically hanging from here like a marionette. The skull floats, as if from a coat hanger, while everything below is pulled down like a garment on that hanger.

Relaxation: ""Song"" is a Chinese word for relaxation that is difficult to describe. Essentially this is a continuation of the alignment step, where you feel a downward pull of gravity on your fleshy parts, meaning your skin, muscles, tendons, and internal organs. Here is where you sink your breath into whatever body part is ""stuck"" and won't relax. You breathe into it until the tension leaves. Try getting a deep tissue massage from a skilled therapist. Odds are they will find a spot that is painful. Have them adjust their pressure, but stay on that point and breath through that pain until it releases. This is the essence of the concept. Healthy tissue should not hurt. This is why Bodhidharma wanted monks to train hard to bring about extreme health/circulation so that they could ignore their bodies for longer and meditate on deeper levels. You can feel this without the pain of deep tissue massage, by just aligning, relaxing and breathing into different areas of your body. But the massage will help you understand the concept faster. The sense of release will be felt in the body. Your muscles will twitch as your brain rewires itself and you will feel a sense of relief and deeper breathing. This is Song. The focus is on relaxing into, and feeling, your body. You are still using your brain and nervous system for this. But not in the same way as when you do trigonometry or looking for tax loopholes... this is cognitive thought. Feeling is also a thought.

Stillness: Essentially harmonization of the mind/body so that there is no experience of a ""you"" that is separate from everything else around you.

Absorption: This is a deeper level of stillness where the brain gradually loses the anxiety of dissociation and settles into ever deeper levels of stillness.

I'll leave points open for debate. But it should be something to this effect. When in doubt, go on a journey, talk to different people, read all the books and develop your own concepts.

Edit: a deepening of the breath comes from a deepening of body awareness or relaxation into the body (and vice versa). At higher levels of attainment the skin begins to breathe deeper as your awareness extends beyond your body. This is usually when cultivators have to leave society and head for wilderness to avoid society's constant insult to the senses.",3,1746553062.0,0
1kg49rc,mqw0tzg,t3_1kg49rc,P_S_Lumapac,"It's one very low level meditation. You can do it forever and get some benefit, but if you're not doing deeper kinds of meditation you are limiting yourself. It's a bit like saying you want to become an athlete, but you don't go past walking.

It absolutely will not get you toward any kind of enlightenment I've heard of.

Along you meditation journey, you can ask yourself a bunch of questions about your mental skills. (if you have visual imagination) Can you imagine so vividly that you're all but in another place? Can you choose to be in bliss or terror or romance within a few minutes of effort? Can you control your emotions under sudden and surprise pressures? Can you control your heart rate, pupil dilation, sweat, hunger and thirst - and can you do so under stress? There's a million million routes, but finishing a stage is almost always marked by unusual skill.

For breath and silent meditation, the speed of entering and the experience of time rushing, are good measures of skill. For instance, can you meditate while making coffee? Can you meditate for an 8 hour flight? I'm not saying these are the only ends of this silent meditation type - just, if you haven't achieved these, you're nowhere near the end of that single step.

It's also really important to know that humans can hypnostise themselves with repetitive actions like praying or chanting or throwing a ball against a wall. You'll run out of all the benefit you will ever get from this in a couple hours. It's a massive trap to keep repeating the same skill thinking you are getting better at some deeper skill. It reminds me a little of terrible drivers who deny it by saying how they've been driving for 20 years!

1kg49rc,mr19y4c,t3_1kg49rc,Andysim23,"Congratulations you figured a small portion of meditation. Breath watching as you call it is a real thing in meditation. When focusing the breath your giving it something to do preventing more of the natural wandering. Like telling you    ""quickly don't think of a purple duck"" is more likely to invoke thoughts of a purple duck than any other thought.  By watching your breath you leave less room for your mind to wander. Next breathing techniques, and watching ones breath are only small pieces to meditation. There is the awareness of mind, of body, of spirit. What you have seemingly done was take one step forward and announced ""I have reached the finish line"" when the race just started. You know what watching your breathing does? It helps you to train your ability to focus and become aware making things like becoming aware of the energy swirling in ones dan tian. The first step isn't a bad one per say but to call it anything more than a first step is disconcerting. You know why breathing techniques exist? Breathing techniques come from specific practices. From box breathing to Kapalabhati and so many others these breathing techniques arose for purposes. Breathing techniques typically work by flooding the brain with more oxygen which improves things like thought. If breathing techniques were unnecessary why would they have survived this long? Breath is spirit? You understand oxygen to be the spirit of? I mean nothing in the Tao Te Ching which is like the only book westerners read mentions little to nothing on this topic. Meditation is not mentioned as a taoist practice which it isn't. A taoist will typically meditate but nothing says to meditate. Meditation comes from the culture. Many taoist had many other practices; these practices are things like Chi Gong and Tai Chi both of which have meditation like practices. After long enough even noticing ones own breath would be deemed a failure for them as a final note. Do apologize if it is a bit incoherent and all over the place just got up.",1,1746608456.0,0
1kg49rc,mrkrpm5,t3_1kg49rc,deleted,"Interestingly, English translations of Lao Tzu differ on this. Feng's translation says negative things about ""controlling the breath"" while Cleary's translation of Takuan's translation doesn't even mention breath in the same chapter. It's hard to reconcile so many different translations, but that's a great book.

While I don't know much about Daoism, it seems unlikely to me that Lao Tzu didn't value the healing and meditative value of breathing, in terms of awarenes. His book is full of recommendations to observe the subtle in consciousness, thought, and action, in order to be more deeply aware -- unless I've read it wrong. When I read that book it's definitely the vibe I get. 

It is actually one of those fundamental things in every tradition, which pays obvious dividends. If you dig deeply into basically any spiritual tradition, you'll find somebody wise recommending syllables and words of power, mantras (which can be used while *breathing in* for super pleasing results -- one can find such words literally scattered around the world, or play with syllables), breathing techniques, pranayama-like things, etc. Recommending one be aware of the parts of the throat, tongue, and mouth, aim for the root chakra, find the centerline, let both of your eyes relax, think about your nostrils, the tip of the nose, the little muscles on the top of the nose near the eyes; let your mouth relax into a little smile or focus on the corners of the mouth without tension, etc. From Buddhism to the Abrahamic traditions and everywhere in between and around, there's always somebody wise recommending it. Not only is it one of the best ways to cultivate awareness, but it's also a fantastic way to reset one's form after something physically or mentally vigorous. Even Musashi speaks of this, actually. I have a habit of scrunching the right side of my face when writing or using my phone, and it has been a good habit to use these techniques to reset my face after such activities (one's whole balance depends more on their face than they know). And to great effect, actually. While skating I've got a whole arsenal or breathing tricks that let me go hard. Aiming for the pelvis allows one to stimulate the legs and the hips. It's one of life's greatest things. There is real power in it, and it's weird to me that these things are not taught in grade school. Once I began playing with these ideas I immediately recognized them in the religious community's more esoteric side, and now I've got like a side hobby of finding that stuff in as many books as I can.

Note that not every language seems to have the same holes in them. The semitic 'kh' sound which, when breathing in, is great for the little muscles in the deeper throat. 'ng' as in ya*ng* is great for hitting some angles (especially after a yin that hits the nostrils). The word for ""water"" in most languages is a good one. Each vowel and consonant is useful in it's own way. For those who want to make these things part of their daily life, practicing them as one practices martial arts moves or anything athletic will build muscle memory, and they will become second nature. For writers, in particular, who may spend a lot of time staring with a side-eye while exercising their writing hand, or anyone else who builds dominance on one side over the other over time with their activities, these techniques are valuable in bringing balance to the body so that they can continue to do those things without settling into a bad local minimum. 

But I'm not an expert. Just my two cents. Almost every religious book on the planet is filled with this stuff.

So, this is more of a description of ""just breathing"" rather than an outline of rules. 

So, if we say, ""just feel the breath"" the way we word this gives the appearance of an instruction, or rule to follow. 

Rather, it is meant to be a description of what occurs naturally when we pay attention to our breathing without imposing ideas goals, rules and distractions. 

All that is left is the breathing and our observing of it. 

Even the complete, or yogic breathing, is unnecessary and gives the appearance of a rule. 

We deep breathe because it gives a more complete filling of the lungs which provides a greater overall long-term benefit, than constant shallow breathing. 

So, we do it because it's healthy not because it's necessary for concentration, or meditation. 

Shorter, shallower breaths are fine and we aren't doing anything wrong when we do this. 

I get allergies every winter. If I try to breathe too deeply i cough 10 or 20 times, which interferes with relaxing and just breathing. 

So, we accommodate ourselves to what is possible to do comfortably. 

When I can breathe more deeply, I do, when I can't, I don't. 

No big deal.

I've skimmed the work and didn't find anything outside of histories and practices. Some parts aren't clear if he's making truth claims or just repeating what his buddhism tells him.

For instance ""the way into stillness"" has this part:

""Thus one cannot will the mind to be still.""

Which is plainly false, as that's a medium level skill in meditation. It might take a couple weeks to learn. But am I supposed to think he's just a poor practitioner or am I supposed to think this is just buddhist teaching? Before that is a metaphor about trying to hold a leaf still, the leaf still moves somewhat - so it sounds a little like he's trying to explain a teaching. Or is he being serious? Does he genuinely think humans can't will themselves into stillness?

Maybe there's a work he's done for buddhists that goes into his own thoughts, so it's clear what has convinced you of his enlightenment.

EDIT: the next section about lights is just funny.

""Although the following advice is for accomplished meditators only, by which I mean those with plentiful experience of jhāna already, it is included here for the sake of completeness. When one is skillful in entering into jhāna and one has experienced a jhāna recently, the mind is so still and powerful, even before one begins to meditate, that one may skip many stages. So much so that one may arouse the nimitta almost immediately after starting. The mind, being so used to nimittas and so favorably disposed toward them, literally leaps onto the nimitta and the nimitta stays. Soon jhāna is reached. For such accomplished meditators, the earlier the nimitta arises, the better.""

Seeing a vivid light independent of your will is a low level meditation skill. This might take a matter of hours to learn. I guess he's saying having this come easy is a good mark of someone who almost has the skill to hold onto blissful states? I doubt it. Having lights like this comes much sooner than being able to choose your emotional states. Blissful states take maybe a month or two of work while seeing lights you could probably get started in one session. Maybe a week to turn them on and off at will, but you'd be better off learning to conjour whole places in that time.

My guess is he would respond ""no no, that's just lights and emotions, these are nimitta and jhana!"" which see my responses above.",1,1746801925.0,6

In Daoism it means a bunch of things, with Wang Bi giving the clearest definition as understanding the eternal (the principles behind principles - something like logic or conservation laws but in his metaphysics too). The idea being, if you understood this you would be great at various positions like ruler or teacher.

If I'm just taking that book as his reports of his own meditation abilities (and I really doubt that, as my guess is he has gone far beyond what he's in my edit describing as ""accomplished meditators"" given he's dedicated his life to it) then he's a completely ordinary meditator with no special knowledge or abilities. He's not really close to a candidate for an enlightened person in any sense.

If by partial enlightenment you mean he has made progress towards gaining special abilities or wisdom or states of being, sure, I don't see him as particularly far along that path. (Again I am guessing his actual abilities go far beyond that book, but just going by that book:) He doesn't seem to be as advanced as your average lucid dreamer in terms of mental abilities. From his wiki article, he doesn't seem as content in life as your average beach bum. It's not clear what aspect of enlightenment he's particularly good at.

But like I said, maybe he has some more advanced work I can see? that's clearly an intro text.

My OP on this thread was encouraging and beneficial for others.

Yours was making ill-informed, incorrect comments about myself and a subject you clearly don't know enough about. 

How do I know?

Because I've actually done what you claim cannot be done using the practices you said won't produce these results, and I accomplished these ""impossible"" results numerous times, using these practices, long before you were born. 

However, everyone must learn their own lessons in their own way.

And you are on your own path to learn your own.

Most likely is he's not very bright (again though, if he's teaching doctrine then this is how it's done and that's fine, doesn't say anything about his abilities) but if he is bright, then presenting his own ideas like this is charlatanism as he's aware it's nonsense.

(It's not always nonsense when someone reads out doctrine that makes no sense. As sometimes learning rubbish or a style of thinking is the point of some lesson. But you'd have to see that lesson described to judge it properly).",1,1746840983.0,1
1kg49rc,mr1u7qq,t1_mr1n3qk,Andysim23,"Few things your biased cognition is showing again. First when did I say what you suggested wouldn't work. If I remember correctly I didn't say that in fact I didn't say that because I know that partial practice in meditation can be helpful. Before I found teachers I used to practice only with breathing techniques only. Siren Hushi (natural breathing), Nihushi (reverse breathing) and embryonic breathing (dantian breathing) all this I will admit was originally book knowledge and breathing was too my thought on the final product to focus on. 


You are right should and shouldn't are not apart of Tao however they are proper english for the use. Tao is action and consequences your not wrong but that doesn't mean there are things which are preferable. The sage will put themselves last. Saying the nobles should take the titles despised isn't in the Tao Te Ching in specific but it is not wrong. Nobles are not the only ones who should take on such titles.
Tao Te Ching chapter 8.
The highest good is like water.
Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive.
It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao.
In dwelling, be close to the land.
In meditation, go deep in the heart.
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.
In speech, be true.
In ruling, be just.
In business, be competent.
In action, watch the timing.
No fight: No blame.


As a bonus we even get a nice little message about the focus of meditation.


Everyone must learn their own lessons on their own? Really? So children learn their ABCs without influence? Children learn colors without interference? Does a martial artist become so on their own? I can agree all knowledge comes from the Tao however if all things are Tao than information from all sources is information that comes from the tao no?


Again still haven't pointed out how I attacked you. You say I attacked you by representing what your biased cognition says is misinformation. Is someone who is truly a practitioner so flimsy that anyone who doesn't agree with you seen as an attack?


A beginner sure I will take this title because in the grand scale of things a person practicing for roughly 10 years is nothing. Being dedicatedly taught for 2 years of that is but a heartbeat to the tao. The 8 years of collaborative teaching is but a breath on the way.


Next let's work through some logic here which I will presume these to be truths. Tao is like water. Water in tao te ching is said to flow to the lowest points. The water in our world moves towards the seas which are the lowest points. Water pools in areas other than the seas. Gutters, gullues, holes, divets ect... Sitting in these pools it reenters the cycle of rain. When it enters the seas it mixes with all the other waters which enter the sea. Now presume this water can have consciousness their goal is to reach the seas. Would getting stuck and reentering the rain cycle be a failure or success. In fact neither because it is only a stop. Meditation is helped by focus and focusing on ones breath does help train the focus. However it's not the seas. Being present in the moment is the basis of meditation. Focusing on breathing is only focusing but a very small part of the present. What sounds are you ignoring because your focused on the breath? What sensations are you missing because your focused on something different. How present can you be while intentionally distracting your mind?


Finally to answer the question of my word choice of should. It is a choice to use softer language as I am only a student of roughly 10 years. Until I am one with the tao again can I truly speak with authority. Until then I use softer language than I used to.",1,1746619039.0,2

All water flows towards the lowest point. All paths can lead to the tao but water can get stuck. You can find distractions that stop you along the way.

Some of them are tall tales. 

I believe everything written in *Opening the Dragon Gate* is true. 

Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. 

When it comes to teachers, I tend to trust those who teach with subtleties and are not direct. For this reveals their shen cultivation. 

Teachers who boast about their righteousness and what is true or false, without showing evidence of the practice of a humility - true humility, not just saving face - reveal that they are not continuing to cultivate while they teach. 

Generally these things are best navigated by one's clear heart. 

But if one is not willing to trust their heart, it means their heart has not become clear. 

The heart and the mind are one - xin. And the heart is that which houses the shen. 

The path to finding true teachers, comes of the seeds planted in the heart - in the home of the shen.

He seemed to indicate that following the tao was a personal endeavour and not a chemical alignment with elements and magnets or whatever. This seems to indicate he believes the tao was a force of judgement.

Also Xiwangmu is given importance when learning about Lu Dongbin, and that is purely a interpersonal type of unity with the Tao - chosen by a diety based on merit. and it has been considered his whole awakening began with a renouncement of worldly attachments and a return to the human needs of companionship and enjoyment instead of ritualised order and superficial meanings such as prized or valuable items as a symbol of self worth and a place in the social order.

""The dichotomy between the Tao of heaven and the Earth is confusing me. The the third line implies that they are talking about the Earth because it is long enduring. But the fourth line sounds like it is talking about the Tao of heaven""

So, it's saying nature has excelling parts and lasting parts, so nature can excel and last. Similarly, a person acting in a certain nature, can excel and last. It is stating this certain nature is not selfishness. Context: Elsewhere heaven and earth are called impartial (selfish is being partial to yourself). I think this also ties into the idea of heaven and earth being used by others, i.e. the use is not from its own desires, and so too the sage or higher person allows others to use them. (EDOT: just realised the author chucked in this reference themselves! Well I don't disagree but the text doesn't have that fifth line. )

Generally at the time, it was believed that acting in line with nature was good and all good stuff done told you something about nature. Each school was concerned with saying what nature was like by what it had, and Daoism gives the answer of nature being without this or that. Here, being without selfishness (being impartial) gives you the ultimate powers of heaven and earth i.e. excelling and lasting.

I think lasting also means withstanding, I'm not sure.

Hopefully breaking it down with parallels here helps see how the meaning is fairly straight forward.

EDIT: 不自生 can also be ""not self generate"" but it doesn't really fit the context so much. I think Selderij is also right that this part of the text can just be long lasting - a rule of translating that you look to context, would suggest that's either a good translation because it's the same as the adjective used on the similar thing earth, or a bad translation because the similar thing already has that reading covered. I would go for excel because well, it's true anyway elsewhere in the text and yeah the alternative is already covered. I probably would argue that parallel structures from the start are concerned with nourishing and achieving as overall themes, and achieving and nourishing here seem to fit the bill - so I'd argue the overall theme of the opening favors excel. No biggy either way.

EDIT2: the text continues with less clear parallels, something like:  
""so the sage stands at the back and so takes the lead, ignores his body and so it lasts, ignores his own private interests and so achieves them. "" note the question above about whether to read it as not selfish or not self generating, fairly clearly falls with ""not selfish"" if we consider the context of the later passages in the same part. I would guess the thrust is this final remark, so the two examples before are demonstrating the form of it. So ""just as ignoring your body keeps you healthy, stepping back has you take the lead, ignoring your own private interests achieves them"". How is that? I guess avoiding assuming something is wrong with you, avoiding assuming the answers, and stepping back as a leader has others step back - well when we step back and then others step back, we lead them but we didn't step back for that reason. So I guess the lesson is if we don't assume answers like what we want and how to get it, and instead let these desires be fullfilled as a natural reaction to our not posturing as having the answers here - that's how we get all our desires fulfilled. This is a plainly DDJ lesson, so I'm going with that for now. Note how the text you're reading is not really close at all.",2,1746420579.0,0

1kephmg,mqoggmr,t1_mqo8vlw,P_S_Lumapac,"I kinda went through my thinking in the comment below.

I guess **Heaven lives long** I would put as heaven excels. Both work but this fits more thematically and structurally I think. Having it as Excels also fits the overall theme of heaven achieving and earth nourishing. Lives long and lasting are too similar - it could be right, but if it is right, what a missed opportunity for laozi, when the alternative reading that does more heavy lifting is right there. Also the second half, casts the sage as having two kinds of desires, one about leadership and one about living a long time, and while leadership could fit with the above... I think it fits with excels better.

And **Is that they do not will their own existence** I would put more as they don't act out of their selves, as it fits the second half more. I guess mainly, the second half ends more explicitly being about putting aside selfishness, but if you take the reading about coming from their own existence, the two conclusions aren't as clearly related. I also think elsewhere heaven and earth are called impartial and that's a pretty big part of the arguments imo, and my reading here fits that better.

I think this passage has very strong ""left right"" parallels as I tried to show, but those don't really play too big a role here. Maybe helps argue that excels is very different to lasting, as why else go to the trouble of making such a parallel if not to contrast differing things? But the passage also has strong ""top and bottom"" symmetry, where the second half repeats the structure for the argument to do with heaven, to show the argument to do with the sage. It is directly applying the argument about heaven and earth to sages, so I think saying these are to be interepreted as analogous in an important way. It is hard to believe the lines just before the conclusions are analogous in an important way if you go with Wu's reading (as I argued above).

Wu also means something like without, so I was making a pun. McTranslation is a better pun though.

EDIT: double checking on the 長, the excels reading also means something like older or mature. Wiktionary says the pictogram comes from ""an old man with long hair"". The second half of the argument is concerned with the sage being an unwitting leader (the sage living a long time I think has to be the long lasting one from Earth). They're a leader in that passage because of who they are not because of efforts to lead. I really think this image of an old man sage sounds like elder, which is a leader who both stands back and doesn't court leadership. This one I'm pretty sure of now.",3,1746437047.0,3

Ziporyn I do give a lot of weight to. Everything I've read of theirs has been good.

I think with such a huge task in carefully translating the whole text, agreement doesn't really mean all that much towards whether I think it's a good translation. I'm far more impressed by anyone who can argue across the whole span of the work (and variations, and historical tidbits, commentaries etc). A good translation to me is one that has consistent translation rules, and Wu's one seems fine - I can't imagine a consistent set being used by McDonald or Mitchel unless ""vibes"" is a rule.

The only time I see a good translation and still don't like it is when I see a rule of ""well this is the common way of translating it so..."" as I think I often see with the opening line. Wagner actually does this. Throughout his works he discusses his translation rules and methods, and it's all very interesting, but there are spots where he just doesn't follow them. One of his rules is to just assume Wang Bi was always right and was reading the best version ever of the DDJ - he says this at the outset that there is this bias, so it's fine. My issue is there are parts where he clearly doesn't do this, and I really think the first line is one of them. My guess is he was picking his battles. I think it would be a rare scholar to stay successful in spite of going directly against widespread agreement, so maybe he thought the same and kept the low stakes passages (debatable) as received.

As cool as I think the historical and academic side is, my interest in the DDJ is that I genuinely think (at least when including Wang Bi's essay on it) the text is incredibly useful. It's a useful perspective even if all the claims about how the world is turned out to be technically false. I think it can change people's lives, if they can at least add this sort of wu wei perspective to the set of options they consider when faced with big decisions.

Local religious groups love to talk about how their society is ""traditionally aligned"" with a specific religion--but that's usually nonsense. For example, the right-wing constantly brays in my country, Canada, about how we are a 'traditional Judeo-Christian nation'. But that only means things like they hate gays, are opposed to letting women have access to abortion/birth control, and they don't want anyone immigrating who isn't a white Christian. 

The other thing to understand is that religious organizations never live up to their ideals when they have anything like a whiff of power. For example, did you know that for a time Buddhist monasteries were a major military player in Japan? The monks wore armor, used spears, muskets, had castles, etc, and fought in the battles of the day.",5,1746379004.0,2

I'm not saying this because they come into conflict. Alls u gotta do is read the texts, its fairly obvious they do not advocate anywhere near the same level of things, nor does Confucianism make any real spiritual/ metaphysical insinuations beyond “learn through interaction or observation” 

Daoist value nature, find social roles and instituionlization to be restrictive and non valuable, spontaneous, ever changing/cretaed metaphysical perspectivism. Action through inaction. Anti authoritarian and anti political. Most importantly Daoism has the Dao which functions as a fundamental principle that works like flux from the Greeks, except even more fundamental. There is no judgement in the dao and it is amoral and spontaneous in nature. There is no right or wrong, no good or bad, no virtue. Daoism is paradoxical and extremely complicated in implication. Only thing close to daoism is Buddhism or Hinduism. Daoism preaches to let go of distinctions. The sage is truly themselves when they are completely empty, not even aware of what is. 

Confucians society, social heirachy, and harmonious society. They value compassion, ritual, and the concept of a virtuous person (completely arbitrary distinction used for manipulation as benevolent is used in religions). Pro government and pro society control. Most fundamentally Confucians believe there is a heaven which ordains the way that humans exist and that reality is inherently ethcial. There is good and bad, there is right and wrong, there is virtue. Confucianism has hardly any implications at this point, we've seen what they've displayed a thousand times over and in many different cultures. Confucianism preaches to observe and manipulate distinctions. The virtuous one is in control of what is. 


Chathoclics and protestants argue with each other about mostly non implicative theories that had already been discussed by ancient philosophers. They differ in church structure, who they think they should pray to, importance of baptism and communion and most importantly adherence to the pope. None of these things are actually that different and loaded with a ton of mysticism/ritual bs, not philosophical in nature a majority of the time. They make up the modern philosophers like 1600s-1800s who are a bunch of people that argue about “rational Christianity” because they're all trying to validate and differentiate their own sects. Descartes started off the party and the rest followed. They made some distinctions in human psychology and such but most of their metaphysical arguments were pretty moot and simple. Leibiniz (the basis for calculus through the conceptualization of moands) is most important, then people like Berekly (immaterialism, an already beat to death point)  and Hume (who notabley dropped the “bomb shell” in human psychology and gave psychological framework to the development of belief,  in a pretty obvious point that ancient Greeks had already discussed).",1,1746476758.0,7

Just read the doctrine of the mean, and analects and compare that to Tao te ching and chuangtze, they're not saying anywhere near the same things.

At least with neoconfucianism, the principles can actually exist while still being Confucian. I don't think that Daoism really means shit beyong its origin as everything its based off of is ignored or manipulated by organizations later on.

Some people are here to do just that, it's probably worth starting your own threads and joining existing discussions about that than trying to gatekeep amateurs discussions and personal philosophies they've gained from reading Taoist texts.

Me personally I'd rather go off what Lao Tzu had to say than about what you have to say about what some other people had to say about what Lao Tzu had to say.

Christianity is a perfect example of the core message of something being warped and twisted over thousands of years of politics and ideology and reiterations and reinterpretations etc. etc. to the point where modern ""Christians"" reject Christ Himself's message and principles.

Surely there is room for discussion in this subreddit around the core values of Taoistic thought from the texts themselves without appeal to authority from modern practitioners?",1,1746451557.0,8

1. the ttc is written in ancient chinese
2. I have a friend from China who studies ancient chinese religion
3. he cannot read the original tao te ching and he is chinese and his life revolves around ancient chinese thought and religion.

—-

yet here we have people telling you what Taoism is, but have no background knowledge on chinese beliefs and practices at the time the Tao te ching was written.

so do you see the problem now? you CAN read the text with a good translation. you cannot make sense of the intended meaning of the text without understanding ancient Chinese beliefs.

and yet here we have all these people telling you what it means!

if you go to a Taoist temple you will encounter people who have a preserved knowledge of how the text was interpreted and evolved beginning over 2000 years ago. Yet no one is prepared to integrate this thinking in to their interpretation!

so I can accept a refusal to integrate Taoism in to the tao te ching. but I cannot accept dismissing the understanding of the text from taoists who have 2000 years of a firm belief from when the text was comprehendable.

I just thought considering you posted it to taoism and referred to a holy text of taoism that you might like some guidance on the meaning of the part of the text you referred to.

I dont care what you think because I know what my intention was and you have zero interest in deescalation and taoism teaches to avoid people like you.

at no time could what I wrote to you have been considered dismissive or condescending. it was providing you with taoist orthodoxy on the text you referred to.

I am actively anti islam. I believe it comes from demons to serve worldly interests rather than pursue spiritual development. i dont believe Moses existed and was a human creation to generate law and order. as I personally believe daode tianjun manifested as laozi and as jesus, and seeing as Mohammed rejects the gospels, I believe Islam is informed by satan as it rejects the Way.

so no you aren't even close.

all I tried do was show you the small section of text you referred to is seen differently in taoism than how your intuition revealed it to you. And it is a divine text. And your intuition is not divine. I do not approach the revealed divine with an open mind I approach it as a revealed and illuminated communication from the highest and do not modify it to suit my self interest. By its very nature it requires me to modify myself to suit the interests of the divine.

This seems to have caused you a great manner of problems.

I really dont care what you do with the text. If you are destined to be inspired by it you will as you will receive undeniably divine experiences outside your own control and thought process. if you are destined to be inspired by yourself and self directed feelings of mysticism you wiill.

picking and choosing based on what? look deeper at the why and you might find some humility and peace.

>at no time could what I wrote to you have been considered dismissive or condescending

what an arrogant and self-absorbed thing to say.

when presented with someone who tells you in no uncertain terms that you are coming across as dismissive and condescending, whilst you are specifically dismissing certain claims they make and talking from the perspective that you hold divine knowledge and they do not (condescending).

who are you to say how your words are being considered by other people? perhaps your conscious intention wasn't to be perceived as such, yet here we are with multiple people telling you that that is the way you are acting. that's about as simple of a sign as it gets, no need for ancient Chinese translations.

1kdwl99,mqf5nva,t3_1kdwl99,OldDog47,"Owl, I had to laugh at *Justified*. It was one of the first series my better half and I binged when we ditched cable and started streaming. We went through all six seasons in like 3 weeks. So, that really resonated. Of course,  now I've (she's gone now) been through countless series over the last few years. 

So, what does it mean to be a latter day Daoist ... how do you go about it? As you point out, there is no one size fits all ... or even many. We are all unique as individuals. Everyone has to find there own formula.

Under the heading of things to consider that I found helpful:

First of all, I had to set aside the notion of religion. Decided that substituting one religion for another was probably not going to be very helpful. By religion, I mean aset of prescribed ritualistic practices largely taken on faith. Seems like that is following someone else's sense of practice. I'm not saying put away religion forever. Just set it aside and don't try to mix it Daoism.

Then, I found physical practice to be important. Daoism isn't just a head thing. The idea being that the practice of Daoism, whatever that was going to mean for me, had to be approached holistically. So, I returned to martial arts. I found a teacher that also taught the philosophy behind the I Ching as related to martial arts. This eventually led to Taijiquan and other forms of Qigong. This helped immensely with meditation. 

If I had to pick one important lesson above all others, it would be learning how not to have to respond to what ... or who ... you encounter. This came out of meditation somewhat, in the sense that meditation can help you to understand that you see more clearly when the mind is quiet. So, I began by resisting the urge to have to interject a point of view in certain settings. Turned out this was extremely helpful when dealing in team settings, where everybody is trying to out-do everyone else. Allowed me to get the broader perspective on where the team was at before offering input. 

Anyway, just a couple of thoughts on becoming a Daoist.

1kd6kdc,mqb0pei,t3_1kd6kdc,Delicious_Block_9253,"Okay, I don’t want to get too into it because there’s a lot of complex history here. But I am going to summarize three narratives. One is the mythical origin of the trigrams and the hexagrams. One is how that’s an allegory for the origin of the universe itself and the processes of change in the universe. And one is modern scholars’ best guess at a historical interpretation of all of this.

If you want to learn about all three of those stories in a lot more detail, then I highly recommend Benebell Wen’s YouTube channel. She has a video on the eight trigrams specifically, as well as the four images, yin and yang, the 64 hexagrams, etc.

So, starting with the mythical origins: There was a cultural hero called Fuxi. He observed nature and came up with the eight trigrams. The order of the eight trigrams was revealed to him when a mythical horse, sent down from divinity, showed him the He Tu, or the Yellow River Map, on its back, which organizes the numbers 1-10 and has lots of numerological and symbolic significance.

Later, during the reign of Emperor Yao, a mythical emperor, Dayu helped control apocalyptic-level floods. The Luo Shu—a three-by-three square of the numbers one through nine—was revealed to him on the back of a turtle. This also has lots of numerological significance. This is a bit of a simplification, but the He Tu describes the innate flow of nature and the Luo Shu helps us understand how to intervene in processes of change. Using all of that information, he was able to design a system of canals to help control the great floods.

Then, King Wen used the Luo Shu to come up with a new order of the trigrams (later-heaven arrangement) and combined those two orderings of the eight trigrams. Using numerological information from both the He Tu and the Luo Shu, he came up with the 64 hexagrams. The Duke of Zhou added a set of commentaries. Later—at least in the traditional telling—Confucius (or more likely, his followers) added even more commentary. That’s how we got the I Ching.

Now, in terms of the symbolic meaning of all of this: there was the great numinous void—or the Tao, or God, or whatever you want to call it. This concept of perfect undifferentiatedness gave rise to qi which gave rise to yin and yang. Yang is a full line; yin is a broken line.

You can combine these into pairs of lines, each of which represents either the culmination of one energy that is beginning to reverse into its opposite, or a transitional phase between yin and yang. These also represent the four faces of the Dao. Then, by adding a yin or yang line to each of those four combinations, you get the eight trigrams that Fuxi came up with.

These are representative of eight forces or energies in nature that can help us understand the various forms that situations can take. Then, when you pair each trigram with every other trigram—including itself—you get a total of 64 hexagrams: a symbolic map of all the possible ways that change can take place in the world and the universe. The five phases of change (wuxing) explain 5 elemental forces that can cause things to change.

This symbolic story is often how chapter 42 from the Dao De Jing is read:

Tao engenders One, One engenders Two, Two engenders Three, Three engenders the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry shade And embrace sunlight. Shade and sunlight, yin and yang, Breath blending into harmony.
(Addis and Lombardo Translation)

or
Way-making (dao) gives rise to continuity, Continuity gives rise to difference, Difference gives rise to plurality, And plurality gives rise to the manifold of everything that is happening (wanwu). Everything carries yin on its shoulders and yang in its arms And blends these vital energies (qi) together to make them harmonious (he).
(Hall and Ames Translation)

Our best guess from a modern historical perspective is that all of this originated from early Chinese folk religion and proto-Daoist practices. In particular, it was probably developed by ritual specialists—often called shamans, though that term is problematic—who used oracle bones and other divination methods to advise rulers and interpret the forces of nature.

Now it’s time for me to editorialize a bit. I believe this incredibly complex symbolic and numerological system arose naturally during a period in Chinese history marked by close ties to nature (giving insight from the more-than-human world), widespread mystical‑shamanic practices (giving spiritual insight), and the birth of the Chinese writing system. Those forces converged to produce a great body of wisdom, and writing ensured its preservation.

That wisdom emphasizes a philosophy of becoming—how things change and morph—far more than a philosophy of being, which classifies and separates. This focus is invaluable, because most modern philosophy, especially in the West, concentrates on being rather than becoming.

Seen this way, the layers of symbols (qi, yin/yang, the trigrams, etc.) - and the I Ching, Tao Te Ching, Zhuangzi, and other Daoist texts - are portals into a culture (or at least subgroups like oracle bone diviners within that culture) that understood how change works with remarkable depth. Of course, the ancient Chinese were not alone; similar insights appear in Aztec and Maya cosmology, Yoruba divination, and many other traditions.

When people hang the Bagua and speak of its power, I see several layers at work. First are the cultural heroes and myths: if divinity revealed the He Tu and Luo Shu on the backs of magical creatures, and if those diagrams guided a sage in crafting the eight trigrams, the symbols are naturally auspicious. Even without that mythic layer, the Bagua embodies the accumulated spiritual, religious, and philosophical insights of countless people over millennia—and that, in itself, is powerful. And, in both interpretations, the way that these symbols represent the very fabric of reality itself carries power.

Sidenote: If anybody reading this is at all interested in Western philosophy as well and wants to learn more about the handful of western philosophers throughout history that has emphasized becoming and not being, I recommend checking out Heraclitus, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Deleuze!",12,1746238010.0,0

The hexagrams form a circular balance. 

It's a representation, a reminder, not necessarily a mystical m[e]ssage, or talisman. 

Many times, when a symbolic representation is used long enough, it tends to acquire superstitious association with good fortune, or bad fortune, when that was not necessarily its original use.

1kd6ia0,mqbpac7,t3_1kd6ia0,P_S_Lumapac,"While I don't endorse it, here is the answer:

The DDJ talks about the valley in the valley, with the language being about the mother, or as Wang Bi puts it, the dark mother, that gives life and nourishes. This dark mother is as opposed to the lord of heaven, which is a masculine figure. Ultimately, the power of the DDJ is the choice to ""remember your mother"" and to reject mere imitation of the father. Remembering the mother means understanding that contrary positions have a similar origin, and politically this would sit well with a philosophy of ""put aside our differences for now..."". 

You're worried about your political movement being demotivated by impotence. The lesson of remembering the dark mother, is that all power comes from this valley in the valley - and remembering that is open to everyone. It is only possible to be impotent by caring for things other than the dao, or in this example, by forgetting the mother. 

Suppose your political group really wanted to stop a racist cafe in your local town. But you've tried talking to people and picketing, but their coffee is just so damn tasty and cheap that you can't convince anyone. To remember the mother would be to see the racist owner's views and your anti-racist views both have the same origin, and the source of power of each is in how you set aside the stringent holding on. In the cafe example, it's likely that the racism doesn't come in at all to their coffee making mastery - that power of good coffee is granted by the dark mother because they do not hold a dogma about it. So, you could set aside those differences and outcompete them with your own coffee that's better and cheaper (or the same without the racism), or on a deeper level, you could think about the need for belonging and desire for freedom and power that underlies both your anti-racist and their racist beliefs, and speak from your heart to the owner to change their heart.

And discussing this creates a 'what came first? The egg or chicken?' dilemma. 

Adding a gender to a quality or action creates a problem out of nowhere.

And this is the main reason why Patriarchy exists in the first place.

Because men created a 'male' imperative on power dynamics and certain actions. 

Matriarchy, while it could ameliorate the issues found in Patriarchy, does not solve a series of root causes which can be found in social inequity and lack of quality education. 

Because men and women, although part of the same species, have very specific biological needs of their own.

1kd6ia0,mq98562,t1_mq8lr7d,Delicious_Block_9253,"Most Daoists historically have considered all of the Daoist metaphysics and numerology to have been, at least partly some sort of divine revelation. This includes yin and yang, the yellow river map, the luotu magic square, elder and younger yin and yang, the eight trigrams, and the 64 hexagrams, as well as the five phases of change, although some of these have some degree of human derivation from cosmological principles or divine revelation. All of this is a formal system of analyzing how a great unity (the Dao, the numinous void,taiji) can produce duality: yin/yang, how change happens (the five phases of change in the 64 hexagrams), etc.

On the other hand, some commentators certainly have made the point that using knowledge of these things to interfere in the process of change may bring about various versions of what Daoists conceive of as the apocalypse sooner. 

All of this is to say that @psychobudist's point about the complexities of yin/yang is very valid, and well supported by what is pretty much consensus Daoist belief throughout history. At the same time, @Spiritual_List_979's point about interfering in the grand plan is a valid one - there's not consensus there. There is a belief (more info below) that using the luotu magic square (which was part of the derivation of the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching) brings on the apocalypse sooner. That being said, that's a slightly more fringe doctrine, many would say it is impossible to truly oppose or interfere with the Dao, since it's all encompassing, and any perceived transgression is a result of our limited human perspective. This same point is seen in many other traditions as well.

Here's some info about the apocalypse thing I mentioned, from Benebell Wen. Important context is that the two maps together are how we get the I Ching, a text you can use for divination in Daoist folk practices.
""The He Tu acknowledges an order to nature's chaotic madness. It's the natural flow of rivers and the movements of the stars above us.
Meanwhile the Lo Shu is like you dividing up and grouping in categories all the stuff in your space and creating organization out of that chaotic madness...
The He Tu River Map, and by river we also mean the Milky Way, because these maps are maps of constellations as much as they are maps of land formations, is the computed simulation of how energy flows in the universe. These are laws. This is the automatic operating system of Nature.
The Lo Shu River Map is a computing system for calculating how to harness and control the way energy flows in the universe. These are formulas. This is machinery. Intelligence.
A manual operating system for exerting your Willpower. This is how you nurture that which was presented as nature.
Taoist occult practitioners read deeply into these glyph formations. Feng shui calculations are heavily reliant on these pathways, as are hand mudras and pacing rituals. **There's also an esoteric doctrine holding that the He Tu is a diagram of Creation and the Lo Shu is not only technology and advancement, but a prophetic, apocalyptic vision of our Destruction.
There's a fascinating yet uncomfortable contradiction here. The occultist must use the Lo Shu to create Change. But the more the technology of the Lo Shu is utilized to change this universe, the closer we are to destroying our universe. In a sense, we are materializing an apocalyptic vision.**"" [Source.](https://benebellwen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-ching-the-oracle-companion-course-lectures-all-transcripts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

And here's some examples of other traditions that make a similar point about the impossibility of opposing the great force of unity/God/the Dao/etc.

“To God all things are fair, good, and just, but men suppose some things are unjust, some just.”

Since you’ve used the language of western philosophy, I will too. Materialism is a metaphysical position, which assumes that the world exists independent of human interaction. Taoism is also a metaphysical position. This from Gia-Fu Feng’s translation of Verse 1 of the Tao Te Ching:

“The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.”

As I understand this, the Tao is nameless and formless. In a sense, the 10,000 things, i.e. the world as experienced by humans, doesn’t exist until it is named. If you can resolve these two ways of seeing things, then you can be both a Taoist and a materialist.",8,1746156495.0,0

1kcpy24,mq5guv1,t3_1kcpy24,Staoicism,"Great question! And one that touches a deeper thread in Taoism: the difference between *pointing at the moon* and *mistaking the finger for the moon*.

You absolutely can walk the Tao while being a materialist or agnostic. The Tao itself doesn’t demand belief >> it invites alignment. Laozi and Zhuangzi weren’t giving us metaphysics to memorize. They were offering lenses to *see more clearly*, *resist less*, and *live more freely*.

It’s true that later forms of Taoism layered in ritual, cosmology, and alchemical traditions, some deeply symbolic, some more literal. Whether you see internal alchemy as energetic transformation or as a poetic way to explore the self, both can serve the same function: creating harmony between your body, mind, and life’s flow.

My take would be something like:  
**You don’t need to** ***believe*** **in the system to benefit from the alignment it offers.**  
Practice what resonates, let go of what doesn’t. The Tao isn’t about conformity. It’s about congruence.

So yes, you can practice deeply - even transform - without needing a spiritual ontology.  
The question isn’t “Do I believe?” but “Does this help me live more in tune with what is?”

Guo Xiang, who edited the version of The Zhuangzi that we have today from 52 chapters down to 33 chapters, took a staunchly anti-metaphysical and atheistic position. Historically, his commentary has been the most influential, so clearly there were Daoists of the Xuanxue 玄學 (NeoDaoism) school of thought who rejected a metaphysical Dao. Here is an excerpt from Brook Ziporyn regarding Guo Xiang's anti-metaphysical stance. There are also other books available on this subject matter:-

>**GUO XIANG (252–312). Responsible for editing the original fifty-five chapter version of the Zhuangzi down to the current thirty-three chapter version, Guo Xiang is also the most influential of all its commentators, his work later being treated as the de facto “official” commentary when the text came to be recognized as canonical in imperial collections. His commentary is based closely on Xiang Xiu’s lost work, to the point of raising suspicions of plagiarism. All later commentators may be assumed to have studied Guo’s commentary closely. Guo’s staunchly anti-metaphysical, anti-foundationalist, and anti-theistic interpretation of Zhuangzi rejects any notion of the Course as creator or source of beings, and with it any ontological hierarchy between Heaven and Man or between the Course and things. Instead, he stresses the concept of spontaneity, or “self-so,” (ziran, ) reading Zhuangzi’s Course as literally nonbeing, so that claims of the Course’s creation of things are to be understood as meaning that nothing interferes with the self-so self-creation, and also intrinsic rightness, of each individual thing. “Self-so” is the antonym of deliberate activity and of the purposive knowledge that goes with it. All deliberate activity, in Guo’s view, is based on the “traces” left by one particular self-so event on another, which come to inspire conscious esteem and emulation, thereby interfering with the self-so process that functions in the absence of cognitions, ideals, explicit values, and deliberate endeavors. Guo often interprets against the grain of the surface meaning of the Zhuangzi text, particularly when it is satirical or critical of Confucian sages or when it seems to advocate withdrawal from active involvement in the world of affairs. For Guo, the critiques in the text are merely of the sages’ “traces,” not of the sages themselves, who were themselves perfectly merged into their own self-so and thus perfectly right in all their deeds, but who thereby unfortunately, through no fault of their own, came to be valued and emulated by later people, thereby undermining and disturbing the self-so rightness of these misguided admirers.

3. there is no meaning to life we create meaning out of what makes us feel good. this is where you get all the intricacies of taoism from with subjective human interpretations.

referring to point 1, if you go to a deeper level there are genetic differences that can be used to generalize a race of people. things like height, IQ, hormone profile, etc can apparently dictate personality traits. they see taoism as an evolution or an expression of these genetic differences ie, ""Chinese characteristics"". so Taoism would exist without the tao te ching as it is an expression of innate chinese behaviors, which only serves as a commentary on the human condition.

The DDJ differs in that the responsibility ultimately rests on the ruler to do good, rather than ministers or individuals. In that way it's an inversion of Legalism that talks of holding individuals and families responsible. The other way DDJ differs is the abandonment of rule of law or similar, where individual tactics or interpretations of law hold weight.

A lot of people remember the use of strict punishment from legalism, and the DDJ addresses this by arguing the absence of punishment is the real goal, where punishment and reward should be come as a surprise from a ruler.

The DDJ is for the most part a response to Confucian ideas and ideas similar to legalism, but while Confucianism at the time can't really sustain a strict heriachy and absolute power in a monarch like legalism, the DDJ argues this is required.

I think it would be nicer if you asked questions or actually responded to the comments others make, rather than just asserting you're right without explanation.

Not about you, just for others reading who've probably seen me talk about this a hundred times before. It's a little strange when the DDJ is like 100 paragraphs long to keep coming across the same misreadings. Similar to the Zhuangzi. Someone commented the other day that they met someone who had bizarre beliefs about what the Zhuangzi said as they were relying on some teacher to tell them, but they wouldn't read it because it was too long. I mentioned it there but God forbid we ask someone to show an interest in their own interests.

Potential expanding to culminate, around some central theme, before returning back to be stored as potential again. 

Metal is the phase of processing and differentiating, so that it can take what has been created in the rest of the cycle and store it up. 

But until it can complete its processing, it doesn't like to let go. 

This is how the mind ends up constantly thinking and judging this from that and right from wrong and making decisions. 

Metal becomes water through acceptance. 

Like the dew settling as the day fades. It can't be forced. It needs to be allowed, and opened up to.

The underlying principles of Bazi -- that there are patterns to existence -- are valid, though. Patterns of two, four, eight and sixty-four make extremely powerful systems of categorization because they are built on fundamental principles of symmetry, which is key to the mathematical and physical laws of the universe.

Other category systems (like tarot) use asymmetric or semi-symmetric categories instead of fully symmetric categories. This makes them very difficult to re-map to phenomena.

But the hours of a fixed time do not accord with nature any longer. 

Zi and Wu are energies in relation to true local midnight and noon. 

Mao and You are energies in relation to sunrise and sunset. 

The wadokai system still follows these principles. But BaZi practitioners do not. 

It is better that these days time zone nuances are taken into account. But what happens when people get into arranged marriages based on compatibilities that are reflected in incorrect timing systems, as has happened in China for many hundreds of years? Humanity becomes estranged from nature. 

Hexagram 30 line 5 relates to the outer clarity that needs to recognize and regret its own presuming to know, so that it may ever remain humble and tethered to true inner clarity. 

I did some work with He Luo Li Shu, and found that it was very accurate - when the timing of the BaZi system it is based upon was rectified. 

Unfortunately, this isn't a system that works outside of the temperate zones - because like astrology, it is based on seasonal archetypes. In regions that do not know spring and fall metal and wood are not present in the same way in the months. And while both systems say they can be used unchanged in the southern hemisphere, western astrology needs to be flipped to match the seasons, according to my research (the famous South African entrepreneur and businessman who is known for giving a child a number for a name and firing people without much evidence of compassion is a Capricorn, not a Cancer.

When astronomers look at Jupiter from Earth they see it between half an hour and an hour in its past. Maybe this doesn't bother most people, but it does bother me because then I wonder my next question, ""Is Bazi limited to relativistic frames of reference?""

As you know, there only one “Ki” or “Qi”, an basic elementary of the universe. 

When this Ki expands, it become sky, masculine, light …. Or Yang: — (a solid line)

When this Ki contracting, it become earth, feminism, dark…. Or Yin: - - (a broken line)

When Yin and Yang reacting, it become The Four Great Symbols:
 
* Greater Yang (太陽 - Tài Yáng): Represented by a solid line over a solid line (⚌). It signifies dominant Yang.
 * Lesser Yin (少陰 - Shào Yīn): Represented by a solid line over a broken line (⚎). It signifies Yang with a touch of Yin emerging.
 * Lesser Yang (少陽 - Shào Yáng): Represented by a broken line over a solid line (⚍). It signifies Yin with a touch of Yang emerging.
 * Greater Yin (太陰 - Tài Yīn): Represented by a broken line over a broken line (⚏). It signifies dominant Yin.

Next, The Eight Trigrams as you see on a normal (Bagua) are formed by adding one more line (either a solid Yang line or a broken Yin line) to each of the Four Symbols. This creates eight unique combinations of three lines.

Here are the names and common representations of the Eight Trigrams, showing how they are derived from the Four Symbols:
 * Heaven / Sky (乾 - Qián): Formed by adding a Yang line to Greater Yang (⚌ + —) resulting in ☰
 * Lake / Marsh (兌 - Duì): Formed by adding a Yin line to Greater Yang (⚌ + --) resulting in ☱
 * Fire (離 - Lí): Formed by adding a Yang line to Lesser Yang (⚍ + —) resulting in ☲
 * Thunder (震 - Zhèn): Formed by adding a Yin line to Lesser Yang (⚍ + --) resulting in ☳
 * Wind / Wood (巽 - Xùn): Formed by adding a Yang line to Lesser Yin (⚎ + —) resulting in ☴
 * Water (坎 - Kǎn): Formed by adding a Yin line to Lesser Yin (⚎ + --) resulting in ☵
 * Mountain (艮 - Gèn): Formed by adding a Yang line to Greater Yin (⚏ + —) resulting in ☶
 * Earth (坤 - Kūn): Formed by adding a Yin line to Greater Yin (⚏ + --) resulting in ☷

The Eight Trigrams (Bagua) are indeed arranged in two primary sequences: 

1. the Primordial Bagua (先天八卦 - Xiāntiān Bāguà), also known as the Earlier Heaven Bagua or Fuxi Bagua. (Row 2,3)

_Order (row 3) (common representation, starting from Qian/Heaven at the top and moving clockwise):
   * Heaven (☰ - Qián)
   * Lake (☱ - Duì)
   * Fire (☲ - Lí)
   * Thunder (☳ - Zhèn)

Opposite counters clockwise, up to down.
   * Wind (☴ - Xùn)
   * Water (☵ - Kǎn)
   * Mountain (☶ - Gèn)
   * Earth (☷ - Kūn)

2. the Manifested Bagua (後天八卦 - Hòutiān Bāguà), also known as the Later Heaven Bagua or King Wen Bagua. (Row4,5)

_Order (row5) (common representation, often placed on a square with Li/Fire at the top clockwise, but when counting, start with Thunder):
   * Fire (☲ - Lí) (South)
   * Earth (☷ - Kūn) (Southwest)
   * Lake (☱ - Duì) (West)
   * Heaven (☰ - Qián) (Northwest)
   * Water (☵ - Kǎn) (North)
   * Mountain (☶ - Gèn) (Northeast)
   * Thunder (☳ - Zhèn) (East)
   * Wind (☴ - Xùn) (Southeast)

There's something truly remarkable about how Macdonald captures the essence of Lao Tzu's wisdom in a way that feels both ancient and immediately relevant to modern life.

What strikes me most is how the prose simply flows from page to page, like water finding its natural course.

1kca1br,mq17uyn,t3_1kca1br,P_S_Lumapac,"Just on the idea that a practitioner would give a better translation, that is almost certainly not the case. It's important to know the original texts are not written in contemporary Chinese, and the leading translators are not Chinese (there are lots of good Chinese translators, but they're not the best in the field - that is changing though as China improves its scholarship).

For those examples, you'll find translators from thousands of years ago having similar variations. The original texts varied between copies and the style was what we might call poetic. If the thrust is similar it's fine. The more interesting differences between translations might be called sweeping.

But I understand just wanting a straight forward non academic reading that doesn't give detailed caveats to each line. Would be nice, but the issue is people who are in the market for that are also in the market for super natural or mystical readings of the texts that simply aren't accurate - they basically inventions of the authors. That's fine, but I'd just say if what you want is some temples teachings, just go to that temple and ask for their teachings. You'll be disappointed if you expect their teachings to line up with a decent translation of the original texts.

just to illustrate the ""it's not Chinese"" point, here's some English (start of Beowulf) from a much smaller time gap (about 1000 vs 2500):

So get a good translation from an good academic (I use the Victor Mair translation---which is old, but so am I). But also try to find a modern language book by a modern practitioner who comes from the same language and culture as you.

1kca1br,mq2pg1r,t3_1kca1br,Delicious_Block_9253,"TLDR: Multiple possible meanings are definitely part of translation studies, and likely intentionally baked into the text itself. If you don't want to think about differing interpretations, just ignore those footnotes in whatever translation you pick. Personally, I ended up choosing Ziporyn as my main reference, but the ones you and other commenters mentioned are all good.

See my comment on u/P_S_Lumapac's post for some points on Native Chinese vs. English speakers, but a bit more pragmatically, it is fair to prioritize different goals when picking a translator.

A Taoist practitioner may be able to better represent modern, on-the-ground interpretations of the text and connect it with Daoist practices and the living tradition. An English-speaking scholar with lots of experience translating Classical Chinese texts, due to the first/second language issue in my other comment may be able to produce a very high-quality translation from a linguistic/text fidelity perspective, especially in terms of rendering meaning/nuance into English. A Chinese scholar whose primary work is the exegesis of Daoist texts might produce a translation that best represents how modern Chinese scholars interpret the text (this will probably align well with things like Chinese academic philosophy, but maybe not so well modern Daoism as a living tradition, like you'd find in a temple). All of these are ""as close as possible to the original Chinese"" in different ways.

Unfortunately, all of this means that there are a broad range of high-quality ways to translate any ancient text, and differences in the goal of translation, who is doing the translation, the audience, etc. can produce somewhat or even wildly different translated texts. It's definitely not a situation where where we can avoid ""multiple \[valid\] meanings for something,"" but then again embracing this ambiguity of language and interpretation is a fundamental part of Daoist thought - as seen in the first line of the DDJ and various parts of the Zhuangzi. This is especially true for texts of the Daoist canon, which have intentional layers of ambiguity, double meaning, and esotericism (in my opinion, although not everyone's).

In general, it sounds like your goal is more about understanding the ideas expressed in the Zhuangzi than diving into debates about philology yourself. In that case, I'd say any of the major translations mentioned in your post or other comments are a valid place to start, each with different pros/cons for someone more interested in practice than scholarship. If you want to avoid commentary on multiple possible meanings of words, trust that whatever the translator put in the main text of their translation is going to be what they think is the best of multiple possible translations. Know that there are going to be hundreds of differences between translations just like trash/blade of grass/mustard seed, and these differing choices tend to be pretty valid! Trust that trash/blade of grass/mustard seed are probably all pretty good ways to get most of the underlying meaning across, but none are perfect. Exceptions are works that have a reputation for dishonesty/inaccurate representation (e.g. Mitchell's DDJ).

Most translators, to some degree or another, discuss these ambiguities at some point in their translation/preface/footnotes/etc. If you don't want to plod through those ambiguities, then just ignore those parts!

All of that being said, I have found that leaning into the philological/exegetical debates and ambiguity here has been an important part of developing my own understanding/practice! All of these problems with interpreting and translating these texts are results of the problems with language itself, a common theme in Daoist thought!",2,1746128982.0,0

Upset a cup of water onto a dip in the hall floor, and a mustard seed can serve as a boat on it, but if you place a cup there, it will get stuck, for the water will prove too shallow and the boat too big. All this clarifies how the Peng flies high because of the huge size of its wings. Now, what the small in mass have to rely on need not be great, and what the great in mass have to use need not be small. Therefore, as principles \[li\] define the absolute capacity \[zhifen\] of things, so things have fixed limits \[dingji\], but each thing’s capacity is sufficient for it to behave as it should; thus the way things operate is the same for all. However, when a thing fails to keep control over forgetting life and instead belabors life beyond limits appropriate to it, then its behavior won’t suit its potential and its actions won’t accord with its innate tendencies \[qing\].When this happens, even wings so big they hang down from the sky will fail to avoid exhaustion, and flyers that suddenly burst upward will fail to avoid coming to grief.

>**Guo Xiang commentary**:- The reason that “only then does it take aim at the South” is not because it is fond of great heights and longs for distant places but because, as long as the wind had not accumulated amply enough beneath, the way forward had remained blocked.

1kca1br,mq2jgfj,t1_mq17uyn,Delicious_Block_9253,"Just to expand on your point about first language Chinese vs. English speaking translators:

The field of translation, for a long time, has considered it better for the translator to be translating *into*, **not** *from* their first language (at least in Western Europe and the Americas). This is often called the ""Native Language Principle."" Various professional organizations, and even the UN have clear guidelines on this. In the past few decades, there's more of a recognition of how a diverse **team** of people from various backgrounds tend to produce even better translations. Of course, this is complicated by the point you make about the difference between modern Chinese and that of the Zhuangzi, as well as the fact that this principle is not commonly accepted everywhere in the world. This can be especially true when you're looking for a translation that represents overall conceptual meaning well - it's easier to interpret nuance in your second language (armed with dictionaries and commentaries) and represent it in your first language, than interpret it in your first (very easy, often automatic) and represent it in your second language (very difficult - easy to write phrases that would be ambiguous, interpreted in a different way, etc.). All of this is why for high-profile realtime meetings (e.g. the UN), there will be one interpreter for each language, each interpreting into, and not from their first language.

All of that is to say that the reason the best translations often have English as their first language is not necessarily a lack of high-quality Chinese scholarship/exegesis on texts like the Zhuangzi but rather the way the brain processes your first vs. your second language and the inherent limitations of second-language proficiency.

It's not what we do, or think, per se, it's our attitude about what we do. 

Nei Yeh Chapter 3 states:

""All the forms of the mind are naturally infused and filled with it [the vital essence], are naturally generated and developed [because of] it.

It is lost inevitably because of sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire, and profit-seeking.

If you are able to cast off sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire and profit-seeking, your mind will just revert to equanimity.

The true condition of the mind
is that it finds calmness beneficial and, by it, attains repose.

Do not disturb it, do not disrupt it
and harmony will naturally develop.""

Sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire, and profit-seeking are emotional feelings we impose upon the outcomes of our goals or purposes. 

When we cease imposing these feelings upon the outcome of our goals disequilibrium doesn't occur.

It's not never desire/want something, it's don't ""need"" that outcome to occur the way we insist it occurs in order to be equanimitous/content. 

We impose emotional imperatives upon the outcomes we pursue and this is what causes our discontent. 

When we emotionally ""need"" an outcome, and get it, we are pleased/happy, when don't get it, we are displeased/unhappy. 

When we cease emotional attachments/impositions to outcomes of our actions we have wishes, goals, and purposes without the attending displeasure when our chosen outcome doesn't occur in the manner we had wished. 

Reading The Taoist Horseman parable found in Hui Nan Tzu Chapter 18 provides an excellent illustration of how a Taoist applies this principle.

1kc2wjd,mq1c72x,t3_1kc2wjd,talkingprawn,"Verse 37 is about the journey of learning not to push.  It is not about a destination where we have no desire.

We will always want things.  We will always have goals, or desires, or needs.  This verse is telling us a way to approach them which promotes harmony.

We could take our desires and push, and shove, and fight.  We could impose our desire on the world.  But when you push on the Tao, the Tao pushes back.  Not because the Tao fights you, but simply because the Tao will not be pushed on.  To say this other ways, the universe always has equal and opposite reactions.  That which swings one way must swing back.  Etc.  if you push, there is always some way that something will push right back.  This expresses in ways we don’t always understand, but it is always there.  It causes struggle, and hardship, and suffering.  Not just for you, but for what you’re pushing on.

This verse (and taken with other ones) is simply saying don’t do that.  It’s not saying we should be able to have no needs, desires, or goals.  That’s silly.  It’s saying we can learn to approach them in a way which dances with the Tao instead of pushing on it.  The Tao will not be pushed, but sometimes it is ready to be leaned on.  Sometimes attaining our desires is not something you “do”, but is a matter of simply learning to recognize all the tiny ways we can move toward a world where that is true.

This is the principle of non-action, wu wei.  It doesn’t mean do nothing.  It doesn’t mean want nothing.  It means learn to read the wind, and in doing so learn to recognize the small currents that are already going where you want to go.  This way instead of pushing on the Tao and creating your own opposing forces, you and the Tao simply arrive there together.

>""All the forms of the mind are naturally infused and filled with it \[the vital essence\], are naturally generated and developed \[because of\] it.

>It is lost inevitably because of sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire, and profit-seeking.

>If you are able to cast off sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire and profit-seeking, your mind will just revert to equanimity.

I think it's a good observation that much of the world operates without resistance. Do you mean you're close to 100% wuwei in that you're physically near to things that are 100% wuwei? Title makes it sound like you're 99% there but then the text makes it sound like you're nowhere near it (which is fine, it takes time).

There's some buddhists in the comments. Would be nice if they started ""as someone who is buddhist and not daoist ... ""

As a general point, wu wei work is still work. No one is claiming the work will be enjoyable or painless.  That would be delusional, or maybe you have some really good painkillers. Wu wei is always described as opposed to taking a resistant path, where resistance is caused by dogmatic or intuitive thinking that imposes an concrete idea on the world, as opposed to flexibility in thinking/action that doesn't impose ideas but reacts. The resistance is not physical effort - you could lead quite a pleasant and effort free life without ever getting close to wu wei (imagine cocktails by the pool). If you do laundry with wu wei, it would be like those tiktoks where the guys fold a fitted sheet in like 3 movements. It would be about getting really really good at doing laundry. Unless you work at a dry cleaners, I would be surprised if this actually was your goal. The resistance would be all your ideas about laundry that when applied to fitted sheets, leave you with a mess. 

A good example of wu wei is when learning to draw, an artist has to go through a phase of removing the idea of marking down symbols for objects, rather than plotting out how the object appears to the eye. If the goal is to present a photograph style image of the world, then drawing a blue glass of water with waves, a sun with sun glasses, or birds as mcdonalds signs, these are all not wu wei.",2,1745988829.0,0

 A master will do things effortlessly it is why they can teach without words but that isn't Wu Wei. To become a master a fair bit of effort is needed but this doesn't break Wu Wei. Wu Wei and effort have no correlation. Wu Wei is acting through a Te guided intuition to take advantage of opportunities  as they present. This intuition is supposed to help you understand when action and effort are needed, when your actions won't help or when acting through stillness is the correct action.


The Tao isn't an effortless path, the Tao treats all as straw dogs; it doesn't become easier or harder it is unbiased towards all, the only thing tao has is natural consequences. In all things effort is required; your muscles move producing effort to keep your heart pumping. The muscles in your chest flex with effort to draw breath. Nothing is effortless; all things require you or your body to put in effort. ""Why is doing laundry so powerful"" that is easy your own biased cognition and a common misconception. Put them together and you get tasks you don't want to do get harder and the tasks you want to do you lie to yourself saying they are effortless; realistically the only thing that living things will find effortless is death because it will come to you no matter the effort you try to exert, this would break Wu Wei.

1kb4j5e,mrdq9in,t3_1kb4j5e,SeekerofDao1,"This is my understanding 

Wu wei doesn't mean ""no motion"" or ""no exertion."" It means no forcing. It’s when your actions arise so naturally from your being—your alignment with the moment—that they cost you no inner resistance. The river flows downhill, and though it's in motion, it's not struggling. The same river could carve mountains, yet it never strains.

The key is whether you are pushing against yourself or acting from yourself. When the mind is in conflict, when we “try” to do something because we must, we feel drained.

In short wu wei it’s not about zero effort—it’s about the absence of strain. It's the doing that doesn’t come from pushing.

Let's say in a more simpler term for example

Just like we walk—naturally, without needing to think—so too does the body move in instinct. If I accidentally place my finger on a hot pan, I pull it away instantly. Not because I think to do it, but because the body knows. It acts without thought. That is reflex. That is instinct.

If I were to wait—if I paused to let the mind understand what happened, then decide what to do—it would already be too late. The burn would deepen. The pain would linger. Damage would take root. But because the body moves before the mind interferes, I am protected.

This is wu wei.

It is action without force, movement without mental strain. It is the way of nature within us, doing what must be done without hesitation. Reflex and instinct are not separate from the Tao—they are the Tao in motion, before words arise, before control takes hold.",2,1746773983.0,0

Yes the butcher says he's that way because he cares only for the dao. He doesn't say he achieved perfect skill the instant he only cared for the dao, but I think that is part of the difference between the DDJ and the Zhuangzi - DDJ makes it sound a bit more like a perfect state, as if a ruler who was wu wei necessarily was a good ruler instantly.

No I think your post is good. I just think the title and the body were a bit different, but you've clarified you mean you are physically close to these things, rather than just 99% close.

I mention there are too many buddhists not prefacing their answers, but I also think there are a lot of Alan Watts types, who really start their thinking with ""the conclusion is that I will achieve some amazing state of ease and contentment, now lets start justifying that using every day examples"". That's fine if you like it, but Daoism is not really the same vibe. Daoism starts with the every day facts, though they sound very unusual if you haven't heard them before - and the conclusion is more pointed to and to be understood than stated. It's not so much that the conclusion isn't the same as Alan Watts, where everything is wonderful, because maybe it is, but with Daoism it could well be that it's not wonderful and yet it's still the right thing to do. Daoism is not motivated by ends. The sage walking along a mud road, isn't supposed to be free of foot infections and hunger.

While I like the commenter, and even think the point is worth raising here, but the top comment at the moment is a plain buddhist statement. It would be nice if it said ""There's a buddhist quote, where before enlightenment you do X and after enlightenment you do X.'

It seems to happen a lot that the top answers in this sub aren't in the daoist ballpark - and it's a big ballpark! Lots of disagreement and many positions to take, it's not at all restrictive to prefer if the top answers were related to daoism in the daoist sub.

My point about Alan Watts is to show that it kind of is similar to daoism, but actually differs in a substantial way that might make daoism unappealing to a Watts fan.

1kbc1bp,mptglhk,t3_1kbc1bp,P_S_Lumapac,"In DDJ, Heaven and Earth are paired up, where basically earth means where people live and heaven is where spirits and specific natural laws live. This is just Chinese cosmology at the time, and I don't think they were trying to more specific than that. Maybe they believed more, maybe less - it wasn't the focus of the texts.

The only spirits mentioned are the Lord of heaven, who sits atop heaven is the analogy to the ruler, and sits like a father figure to the other analogy of dark mother who resides under Earth. These are likely not literal as they are limited to these functions and not personified. Similar to ""mother of invention"". The Yin Yang stuff is not related beyond these analogies - Laozi did not care about Yin Yang stuff. Without much controversy Wang Bi translated the Yin Yang passage to be about hens and roosters - it really wasn't an important line.

As I said, these aren't really important. For this general Daoism what's important is that there is something higher that allows this set up of heaven and earth. This is called Dao in the broad sense that Chinese thought generally uses it. (the DDJ goes further to talk of the higher Dao, and relates this to heaven but that's separate. That's what the DDJ is about, and it's implication for ethics too).

I think it's interesting that many Daoist religions today do concern themselves with the cosmology and many people attracted to the original texts also want to know about supernatural levels of existence. This really couldn't be further from the original texts, that simply didn't make any claims about these. Confucius was the other big school at the time, and also didn't think much of these ideas. That era of philosophy is largely marked by humanism, even the competing legalism really didn't care for this talk.

You might be interested in asking specifically ""in your Daoist temple, what do your teachers believe about heaven?"" because the more broad question of daoism will refer to the DDJ and Zhuangzi which don't really talk about supernatural stuff. You could argue the DDJ's metaphysics is supernatural, but it's not personified or somewhere life is, so I don't think it's what's meant.

In terms of tracing where the supernatural bent comes into Chinese thought, maybe 600 years or so after Daoism, Buddhism showed up, with the joke ""first they had to teach the Chinese they had souls before teaching them they didn't"" because Chinese thought for the most part was dominated by humanist ideas not supernatural ones. (The irony here is there has never been a religion that more strongly believes in and obsesses over eternal souls than Buddhism, while the early teachings were radically humanist. About 15 years ago Zen decided it would stop believing in eternal souls, but one wonders in what way it remains Buddhist given it now looks nothing like any other Buddhists. Most Zen Buddhists still believe in eternal souls.)",5,1746009997.0,0

To develop some understanding of what *Heaven* means one needs to look how the various early schools and texts use the term and in what context. Westerners need to suspend their understanding of Heaven as received from Abrahamic sources in order to appreciate what Chinese might conceptualize. 

*Heaven* is often seen as an initiating principle which, in the manifest world, endows things with tendencies and dispositions in the form of spirit. This in complemented by *Earth, which represents the receptive (of what has been initiated) principle that nurtures and develops things. This accounts for all manifest things, hence the understanding the phrase *all under Heaven and Earth*, that is, all things manifest.

So, *Heaven*  is not an independent supernatural place, as often thought of in Abrahamic religion, but rather as an active principle (paired with *Earth*) of creation as manifest in nature.

The first thing any non-Chinese reader should understand about tian is that no one in the history of Chinese thought ever doubts its existence. Even the most skeptical thinker would not deny the existence of tian; rather, he would say that tian exists and that it is simply that blue sky above us. This makes the term very unlike “God” and its equivalents in Western traditions, and perhaps closer to “Nature,” which similarly is something the existence of which is never contested. In both cases the only issue is not whether it exists but what its character is: personal, impersonal, deliberate, nondeliberate, spiritual, material, moral, amoral, conscious, unconscious. This primary meaning of “sky” is never absent in the word, in its most rudimentary and undeniable sense: what is up there above the reach of human beings, where weather comes from, which changes through the seasons and thus sets the conditions for all human activity but is beyond human manipulation. That contrast to purposive human activity remains the core element in the idea of tian no matter what further content is added: tian is what is not accomplished by any deliberate human actions, but which conditions human actions. But “sky” also functioned as a metonym for whatever deity or deities may be living in the sky, much as the “White House” is sometimes used to refer to the president of the United States, or “Hollywood” is used to designate a complex collective conglomerate entity like “the movie industry.” It was so used to designate the ancestral deity or deities of the Zhou imperial house, whose moral “mandate” underwrote the Zhou overthrow of the Shang dynasty in the eleventh century BCE. Tian in this usage tended to function as a patriarchal sky-god of the kind typical of many ancient cultures. With the rationalizing tendencies of the Spring and Autumn Period (770–475 BCE), however, including the early Confucian movement, the naturalistic association with “sky” began to grow more pronounced as the anthropomorphic and morally retributive aspects of the term were dampened. In the Analects, Confucius sometimes uses the term with clear but possibly rhetorical anthropomorphic implications, but elsewhere in the same work he states that Heaven “does not speak \[that is, issues no explicit commands\], and yet the four seasons proceed through it, the hundred creatures are born through it” (Analects 17:19). The naturalistic sense of Heaven as the plain process of the sky seems to be present in this pronouncement. Interpretive hedgings continued in the work of Zhuangzi’s contemporary Mencius, representing what would later be deemed the mainstream Confucian tradition. Mencius sometimes reduced the meaning of Heaven explicitly to simply “what happens although nothing makes it happen” (Mencius, 5A6). This is the sense of the term that emerges front and center in Zhuangzi’s usage: the spontaneous and agentless process that brings forth all beings, or a collective name for whatever happens without a specific identifiable agent that makes it happen and without a preexisting purpose or will or observable procedure. This is “skylike” in the sense that the sky is conceived as the ever-present but unspecifiable open space that “rotates” tirelessly and spontaneously, bringing the changes of the seasons and the bounty of the earth forth without having to issue explicit orders, make or enforce “laws” or directly interfere: the turning of the sky makes the harvest without coming down and planning and planting, its action is effortless and purposeless. The Heavenly in all things is this “skylike” aspect of all things. The term “Nature” has been used by some early translators, but the implication of Nature as an ordered and knowable system, running according to “Natural Laws,” which are rooted in the wisdom of a divine lawgiver, is profoundly alien to the early Chinese conception of spontaneity, which excludes the notion of positive law as an externally constraining force. Since the term no longer refers to a particular agent but to a quality or aspect of purposeless and agentless process present in all existents, it is here often translated as “the Heavenly” rather than the substantive “Heaven.” But the English “Heavenly” should not be taken in its loose colloquial sense as an exclamation of praise meaning something like “simply marvelous!” Similarly, the English term “Heaven” should be stripped of any implications of a pearly-gated place of reward to which people go when they die.

On the other hand , if we say that this whole universe consists of yin energy and heaven another universe above our universe which consists of yang energy , dao is then one which contains both of them and immortals are the ones that travel between two universes.

Zen as I said, is different as in the last few years many have come out against this view of the eternal soul as plainly and obviously anti Buddhist.

An eternal soul is a ghost that puppets a body, and when the body dies, the ghost continues to exist, sometimes puppeting a new body, sometimes off in space, sometimes dissolved into other ghosts.

In orthodox Mahayana and Vajrayana you realise how things appear and how there is no self (anatman) and how all phenomena is empty and dependantly arising (sunyata). When you realise this you become a Buddha. You can only realise such things through meditation. 

This is not a debated matter. When you are enlightened you may demonstrate the act of passing away but Buddhas in their compassion manifest many emanations (Nirmanakaya) to guide beings in Samsara. Beings are affected by past lives (e.g karma), or they may remember things from past rebirths, but this does not mean there is anything “retaining” or creating this ability. Karma causes the vijñana which to continue causes another body and that body becomes the next life. A being’s karma determines whether they remember past lives and where they are reborn and who as. There is no self, I say again.",1,1746413317.0,7
1kbc1bp,mqned1v,t1_mqn8qic,P_S_Lumapac,"No I'm genuinely not. I am saying some buddhists use word games to avoid stating what they believe.

Yes I agree, buddhism should be against this idea of shiny souls. It just so happens that most buddhists aren't against it. They obsess over it.

Yes remembering things from past lives or being impacted by the actions of past lives is an eternal soul. You want these next lives to be good, by polishing your ghost as much as possible. A ghost isn't a real thing in this world - it's supernatural. We imply a ghost's supernatural existence because of the impact of supernatural events. One person dying then another person having memories of that dead person is, if confirmed and without other natural explanation, is strong evidence of supernatural ghosts existing. Souls are always thought of as existing in this supernatural sense - implied by the occurence of supernatural events e.g. prophets, speaking with dead, etc. Saying it's not a ghost even though you are saying one dead persons memories are showing up in another living person, is simply word games to avoid admitting you believe in eternal souls.

Just focusing on you then, do you believe one of the benefits of your spiritual practice (meditation, praying, being moral etc) is that your next life would be better for it? (I'm not asking if that's a motivation, just whether as a fact it is a benefit).

EDIT: To anyone else reading, the usual response is, person A dies, and later on another person B is born, and with nothing occurring in between the chain of person A's experiences continues in person B. For instance, if A was good their whole life, good things will happen to B, and if A was a brilliant teacher, then B might be a brilliant teacher too. There are all kinds of variations to this, but the response to why it's not a soul is that many aspects aren't carrying through - but memories, purpose, karma etc are carrying through. At best this is an argument that buddhists believe in a partial eternal soul, but that seems silly as many religions that believe in eternal souls also believe in partial eternal souls e.g. Christians who don't believe marriage exists in heaven, as heaven doesn't have the same kind of life. So yes they believe in eternal souls. Some will even go so far as to say during this life they can ""see"" the taint on the soul i.e. not shininess, that's accumulated as if they can perceive auras. Many more believe they can sense this aura in themselves.",0,1746415513.0,8
1kbc1bp,mqnijy7,t1_mqned1v,nongoos,I’m not debating this. That is not what a soul is nor will I continue this conversation when you are genuinely getting it wrong and calling incredibly long philosophical history “word games.”,1,1746417321.0,9
1kbc1bp,mqnjm3f,t1_mqnijy7,P_S_Lumapac,"Word games is when everyone is agreeing on what the thing is, but you are disagreeing about what to call it. I agree with the buddhists who believe they are passing on karma for instance, but it is word games to not call this an eternal soul, a ghost, a whatever supernatural entity. I'm happy to call it whatever they want to, but it's equivalent. It would be word games to purposely lie about that.

It's like saying ""this isn't a truck, it's a utility vehicle"" sure, call it whatever you want, but it at least a truck.

Anyway, it seems you do believe in an eternal soul too. I hope yours is very shiny and in your next life you are rewarded for all your polishing.

What I would suggest is listening closely to other buddhists you know irl, especially pios ones who pray regularly, and try to work out how they really think about their karma being passed on to the next life. I bet you will very quickly see they are talking about their eternal soul, then you might be able to see it in yourself. I brought the topic up above because Zen is interesting in moving away from this soul polishing idea, basically because yes, it is just word games to say it's not an eternal soul.",1,1746417804.0,1

qi/chi is the word used in taoism for 'energy' and it also gets used as a summary word for a range of energies.

The Micro Cosmic Orbit is the foundation of Taoist Yoga/Qi Gong. The circulation of energy between Heaven and Earth, the human being the conduit or ""bridge"" between pure Yin & Yang. Inhale up, exhale down. Letting the tongue drop with the heavy, dense Earth Qi of Yin. 

This is also the idea behind the moving arms up, gathering Heaven and bring that in thru the top of the head and hands sinking down in front of the body, like you see in so much Kung Fu.

Two weeks ago, the buzzing in the base of spine started back up more frequently. It’s not painful. It started back up when I was at the botanical garden. 

It always cycles, just not sure what type of cycle. I was told that the energetic nature of this is more similar to Kundalini and told not to try any Asian practices. But back then when I was looking for answers and trying to find relief- I was told a lot of things lol. 

There is even a cycle with my tongue which is mostly always against my palate unless I’m talking. Do u know anything about this? The guy in here before mentioned kechari, a yogic practice. I dont want to do that.

1kbihn4,mpvrbfs,t1_mpvi1fa,neidanman,"when you say a cycle what do you mean? does it feel like a cycle of energy moving around in the area in a cycle? If so these are quite normal. Depending on the strength of the cycle and how established it is, it can be clearer more or less quickly. The basic method uses a principle called 'yi dao qi dao' - where the awareness goes, the qi follows. This is how people can end up clearing things by leading energy round, like if you try and use it to do the MCO.

So if you think the cycle is a bit like an area of dirt that has been worn into a groove, and now energy is just cycling round and round, you need to cut across/breakup the edges of the groove. Depending on where you are in your development you'll be able to lead more or less energy to the area to do this, so this also impacts how much effect you can have.

One main point when doing it is to focus on a tiny part of the edge and put all your energy across it, back and forwards. This focusing is a bit like using a nail to break a sheet of tough glass, rather than a fist. The more concentrated the energy, the more easy it is to break up the cycles.

kundalini and eastern practices are often misunderstood. my practice has been through daoist arts since '98. Also i've been looking into the theory side more for the past 10 years or so. i wouldn't say the cycles are especially linked to either tradition. Kundalini has a potentially 'obvious' but incorrect mention of it in terms of the coiled serpant (spiral energy). Repeating cycles though are more linked to samskaras/sankharas, or 'tethers' in daoism. These are more individual cycles that can come up in any part of the system.

tingling at the spine is also common in both, as both have an aspect where qi/prana/kundalini makes its way up through the spine. Heat is also common in both. The connection of the roof of the mouth and tongue is mentioned in daoist arts as part of the 'ren channel', which goes down the front of the body. The tongue touching the mouth roof is seen as helping to connect this channel/be a part of it. Kundalini based practices also use this.

The roof of the mouth is an area known for having a 'granthi' on the kundalini side - a particularly difficult energetic knot that needs undone/cleared. Daosim talk of a 'clipping pass' in the same area - an area that can be harder to open.",1,1746036913.0,2

1kbihn4,mpw15mh,t1_mpvrbfs,SunnyDD000,"So I can try to explain the cycle. It starts at the perineum area and it feels like a constant pumping motion (sometimes like twirling pumping motion, sometimes just straight upwards), through the entire core of my torso and then to my neck up to my tongue and then to the head. This is always constant. The back part of my neck is where the energy will be hot and then sometimes in my face. 

As for my tongue, the cycle is tongue presses upwards naturally, and the flow in one motion moves from perineum, spike/torso, neck and to the base of tongue to the tip of tongue. From the tip of tongue, the energy does this downward loop and then gets both sides of the tongue in the back. Sometimes it will be more apparent on one side - and then it the energy goes up through the palate. Behind my eyes or center of the bridge of my nose. Sometimes it goes all the way through the top of my head, but seems it’s a small stream of it. 

Hope I explained it well enough",1,1746039808.0,3
1kbihn4,mpw8xqs,t1_mpw15mh,neidanman,"sure i think i get it more now. The closest thing i know from experience was having waves of energy come up from the base, pass through the body, then usually release out the top of the head, but sometimes get 'stuck' part way up. They would come in batches going for up to an hour or so, and would be in waves every second/few seconds. They lasted on and off for a month or so and mostly happened at night, but at other times too.

from what i can tell/compare it to, its part of a purification of the system. The yogic system talks of it as part of either a pranotthana or kundalini process, [http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1970s/1979/7903/7903prkn.html](http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1970s/1979/7903/7903prkn.html) . Daoism talks of it as 'post heaven qi' clearing 'turbid qi'. Its not something you would normally want to adjust, more you would want to let it play out and clear/adjust the system as needed. Both systems view this level of energy as having its own intelligence and we basically apply 'non doing' awareness to what's going on, to work with it and help the process play out - this is a short take on the daoist view of this in practice [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmIe5jWBYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmIe5jWBYY)

active practices at this stage then are more there to help things go more smoothly and that aim to make the work of the energy more easy. Some from the first link that might help are - 

Practicing 'ting & song' - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1y\_aeCYj9c&t=998s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1y_aeCYj9c&t=998s) \- Roughly this means to listen/sense inwardly & release. The video is a \~4 min answer section from an interview explaining it.

Song - [https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-five-theory-wu-ji-and-song-relaxation/](https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-five-theory-wu-ji-and-song-relaxation/) \- Conscious/knowing release can be used to help open the body. As it opens it can become more conductive to energy. So energy that has been blocked may be freed up and start flowing away from wherever its pooled.

Dissolving/clearing blocks - [https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-six-theory-dissolving-clearing-blockages/](https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-six-theory-dissolving-clearing-blockages/) \- Moving awareness to the blockage, rather than the buildup of energy can help to dissolve it. E.g. with a energy built in the head, you can move the awareness into the 'dead space' around the energy, and this can lead the energy into 'dissolving' the block.

Soft-butter method - [https://buddhismnow.com/2015/09/12/zen-sickness-by-zen-master-hakuin/#:\~:text=The%20Soft%2DButter%20Method](https://buddhismnow.com/2015/09/12/zen-sickness-by-zen-master-hakuin/#:~:text=The%20Soft%2DButter%20Method) \- Visualisation is used here to try and help guide energy down from the head to the rest of the body.

Yes - that's not daoist. At least not Classic Daoism. There is no ""Karma"" in classic Daoism. Only in late branches blended with Buddhism.

Jing ( Life seed / essence) and Qi (Life breath / energy) are giving birth and Life and De (profound virtue, potency, power) nurtures Life and protects it and brings Life to fulness - before it returns ( Laozi 51, 40).

When Jing and Qi are depleted and dispersed, Life (sheng / ming) ends and form (xing) decreases and changes (hua).

The wise man (Sheng ren) or the true man (Zhen ren) understands and welcomes this process of Life and Death. That's about calmness (jing) in and acceptance of change (hua).

Some Daoists try to stop that process - those are the Xian (immortals) and the Neidans (Inner Alchemy).

1k9zjfa,mpiexyd,t3_1k9zjfa,Delicious_Block_9253,"The history of the Dao De Jing is debated. Lots of people don't think Laozi existed, and that the book was a bunch of folk wisdom/sayings written down, and probably well before Confucius. Stories about Confucius and Laozi meeting are common, and that likely has to do with people repeating them to support a certain point they're making (for example, a common story is that Confucius was seeking Laozi's wisdom, which proves some people's point that Taoism is better than Confucianism).

  
It's probably not the most useful or accurate to reduce Confucianism to rigid, misogynistic views, OR to reduce Daoism to opposing them. Both traditions have had/have misogynists and feminists, people in support or against a given social policy or leader, etc. explicit or otherwise. I think it is fair to say that Confucianism tends to focus more on the human world and believes there is more of a place for intentionally designed, top-down social organization, but the Dao De Jing can be read as a manual for those ruling a country and has many passages obviously directed at national leaders - implying that it sees social hierarchy as, at the very least, a truth we have to navigate, and maybe even natural and good, when done right. I think it's also fair to say that Daoism tends to emphasize naturalness, and following the way of nature instead of rigid human ideas of proper conduct, but Confucianism certainly has these elements as well - Confucius writes about the 道 (dao) - the same word that gives us Daoism. Confucianism has been used by many progressives to argue for progressive ideas. To some degree, there's an argument that these categories, along with other philosophical schools in China, came well after the texts were written - a more recent invention.

  
I think one of the strongest ways to show this point is that all throughout history, all the way to the present day, many people (of a broad range of political/philosophical beliefs) practice/follow Daoism \*\*and\*\* Confucianism \*\*and\*\* Buddhism \*\*and\*\* Indigenous Folk Religions \*\*and\*\* plenty of other things, all at the same time. These are big philosophical traditions that don't fit neatly into the boxes we have in the West. While there's certainly a dialogue between these traditions, and it has been, at times, very adversarial, it has at other times been mutually enriching. For example, the I Ching, considered a foundational scripture of Daoism, was one of the texts most analyzed by early Confucian scholars, and the commentaries on it that almost anyone who studies it (including Daoists) were written by Confucians.

Using Daoist philosophy itself to make this point, the ""yin"" of Daoism requires the ""yang"" of Confucianism for balance. To understand things well, we shouldn't only look at one and ignore the other. Or, from another perspective, ideas, like water, are inclusive and flow naturally. Ideas from Daosim came to Confucianism, and vice versa, and those ideas exist in individual minds as a broad variety of nuanced perspectives.

Confucius wasn't some malicious psychopath looking to oppress children and women. He was very much an empathetic sage concerned with optimizing wellbeing of humans in harmony with nature. He accounted for both the roles of men and women and thought of systems to enforce their respective duties in a way that doesn't put either party at disadvantage.

Of course it doesn't eliminate human suffering completely but our current chaotic structure doesn't eliminate it in the slightest either. With prescribed structure like Confucianism people set realistic expectations as it has law prescribed way of resolution of almost every standard situation.

>say your dad is an alcoholic and your mom is a prostitute.

This is a typical counter argument - but legalist systems eventually find ways to resolve such problems in literally the most optimal way.

Let's look at your example - what happens in western democracy? Kids are free to do whatever they want, disrespect their parents, etc. but they still are legally tied to them until they reach adult age. Help options are limited. Without proper upbringing they go feral, start forming violent gangs, get into drugs and end up on state's budget in prison. Worst case but increasingly common scenario - they die on the streets.

Legalist system has planned scenarios where neighbors report the parents and they simply remove the child - much similar to what we have now. They might set him up for army training, which probably sounds brutal to you at first. But such solution offers SEVERAL advantages over time:

* Parents are legally threatened to have their children taken away, much like they currently are in many developed democracies.
* The capacity for army training is unlimited, they pay for their education and make them relatively well-adjusted members of society.
* State gains from this loyal and highly motivated soldiers for their military AND IMPORTANTLY in return also is bound to give them ranks and retire them at legally defined age.
* In current system there are extremely limited ways out of poverty and joining the army is likely one of the best options one can make in such scenario, especially if the other option consists of playing war on the streets.

Specific example:  
*Legal codes criminalised abandonment: if a child died after being left without care, the parent could be charged with “killing a minor relative”, punished by strangulation (Tang and Ming codes). If the child survived, the parent still faced 100 blows and exile. In Qing times each prefecture was ordered to maintain an official* ***foundling home*** *(1720 edict), though funding was uneven.*

TLDR: **People bring up specific measures from Confucianist and Legalist practices and completely ignore much more massive and radical counter-measures.** How bad would you have to fuck your parent's shit up before they report you for disobedience, especially  if they know there's death penalty for it? It's much easier for a child to report their parents (much like they do in our current system) and penalties are much more strict for it than today.",2,1745948446.0,6
1k9zjfa,mpp4502,t1_mpp2038,Spiritual_List_979,"Confucius was 100% dedicated to maintaining the supremacy of the state.

1k9zjfa,mppayp3,t1_mpp4502,60109,"That's simply not true. 

Laws were mainly concerned with maintaining public order - family affairs were handled within family, again, as they should.

I think the main thing you are ignoring is importance of one's family clan during that era. Unlike today, thanks to basically forced relationships between family members, they maintained much wider social net. Uncles, aunts, grandparents and their siblings would all keep a close eye on other members of the family. They were all concerned with keeping the family's image up. Family clan embarrassment was a big deal so they made extra sure to deal with any black sheep. 

Confucianism is at its core hierarchical collectivist system. State defines via laws only the structure and regulations of societal order. Social and interpersonal issues are delegated to the smallest cell of the state - the family. As pretty much a state defined entity which often had material possessions attached to it, it played much more important role in people's lives.

Instead of each member of the family fending for themselves they tried to rise the family as whole to more prestigious level.

humans are quite simple in the sense that they are created to care for each other and form family units. there is no need to codify those behaviours unless you are trying to control them for some type of benefit - in this case governance and a social order with boundaries that can be policed, thus maintaining a conformist and predictable society to govern.",1,1745951743.0,9

In your example of non-conformity, the system itself was based on discrimination and was unsustainable in itself. Still, people who rejected Nazi regimes made exactly 0 difference - the regime only failed because Germany got defeated in war, not because of some non-conformists.

Are you familiar with I Ching -  Book of Changes? Confucius held this ancient book in the highest regard and he and his school wrote extensive commentaries on it. The book itself served as a basis for both the Confucianist ethics AND Taoist canon is largely based on that book. Even multiple passages and concepts presented in Tao Te Ching can be directly traced back to it. 

The whole idea of that book is to describe universal natural patterns using 64 hexagrams representing archetypal situations, which can be applied to literally anything including agriculture, family relationships and government. It's essentially a model of every possible situation one can get into and includes Judgements on the most optimal course of action for each. This optimal course of action is what's been later called the Tao - the books predates the concept of Tao by almost a millennium. 

Taoism and Confucianism are not opposing doctrines. Even Confucius himself used the word Tao. He just took a different approach to it's practical application - inspired by the ancient Book of Changes he attempted to design an ideal system of government and ethics modeled after what's natural. You even agree to this when you say ""a 6ft male with being subservient to a 5ft tall woman is unnatural and unbalanced"".

He simply chose to leave the areas of spirituality and individual well-being to other sages. That's why Confucianism historically existed *concurrently and in harmony* with both Taoism and Buddhism. 

For Taoist living in a Confucianist state is really the perfect combination because you are always able to easily read every situation and react accordingly. When the role of father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, lord and servant are all clearly defined, it becomes much easier to just go with the flow. 

Nowadays the lords (which we call CEOs) are free to place the burden of responsibility on servants (which we call employees) - because on paper we are all socially equal and all on the ""same team"". In a rigid system servant is a dependent of his lord, much like a child is a dependent of its parents. Lord has essentially unlimited power over his servant but it's completely balanced by the weight of responsibility this comes with. 

Amazon treats their employees like shit but nobody cares because ""it's a free market and it's well within the bounds of law"". If a person doesn't do well these days we simply say they are not trying hard enough in life, put all the blame on poor peasants. In the days of Confucius, if a servants were treated poorly it would destroy the image of the lord and others would condemn his actions because associating with such man would destroy their image as well.",1,1745999510.0,3

1k9zjfa,mptoxkf,t1_mptdu4e,60109,"I thought you were being sarcastic at first about wanting to be educated on it. Sorry for misunderstanding.

I Ching started off as a divinatory system but compared to Tarot which is only a few hundreds years old, I Ching was refined over thousands of years. It's essentially an enclosed 6-bit binary system consisting of hexagrams with alternating values of yin (broken line) and yang (solid line) as you correctly pointed out. Fun fact: binary mathematics in the west were invented by Liebniz after he translated I Ching and he even attributed his discovery to it.

Now unlike Tarot who was practiced by occultists in secrecy and in periphery, I Ching was at the center stage during the early Chinese history, as divination was one of the domains reserved for the ruling class. Imagine all greatest philosophers and sages collaboratively working on a system of associations which would cover the entire spectrum of all possible situations.

That's also the grand purpose of I Ching - describe in the 64 archetypal images all the possible situations (or 'Changes') that could happen in every possible area. That might sound like an insanely ambitious goal from our current western rationalist perspective. 

The way ancient sages (history is blurry at this stage) did this by defining the first two hexagrams Qian (the Creative, heaven, all yang lines) and Kun (the Receptive, earth, all yin lines) as the points of reference. Every other situation is then defined as a place between those 2 extremes. If you imagine it like a color spectrum the remaining hexagrams attempt to cover every kind of color by being spread out evenly over the spectrum with equal spaces between them. 

In certain situations despite them being distinct, similar parts of the brain activate and similar thought processes arise. It took thousands of years but I Ching is essentially a human brain-map. In it there is encoded optimal solution for every practical problem. It's basically a complete guide book on how to approach any situation in harmony with the Tao. Taoists extracted their maxims from the practical advice presented in the book.

Now how it ties to Confucius and Legalism? Confucius recognized the ingeniousness of the book and decided to apply the clearly-defined structure of order and hierarchy into lawmaking. He basically took the blueprint (already refined over a thousand years during times of Confucius) and created the ""perfect"" government system in accordance with it. He simply had no underlying evil motivations and really just wanted to create peace and harmony in society. Similar ideas of perfect political systems have been proposed by Plato and Socrates but were never attempted to be put into practice unlike Confucianism.

Just because nobody implemented it correctly yet, doesn't make it a bad or unjust  system, that's my point. Unlike modern systems it wasn't designed to oppress and provide illusion of freedom but rather set out clear rules of the societal game.",1,1746013832.0,9
1k9zjfa,mpts53j,t1_mptoxkf,Spiritual_List_979,"so we agree I Ching is similar to tarot as it is a divination tool.

we disagree on the meaning behind I ching as you say it is neuroscience and I am of the belief it is related to spirituality. 

I do not agree Confucius has anything to do with I ching. he created a corruption of the concept, retained the name of it and promoted his agenda as authoritative.

he could have come up with a concept of his own but instead he took an established concept that people ascribed divine authority to and twisted it for his own benefit and to enforce political control over civilians.

>The [*Shiji*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiji) stated that the neighboring [Qi state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state)) was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state.[^(\[32\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius#cite_note-FOOTNOTENylanWilson201017-32) According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu.[^(\[32\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius#cite_note-FOOTNOTENylanWilson201017-32) The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.

He was HIGHLY concerned with personal morals and even forfeited any political power he had in favor of remaining true to his ideals. 

Wikipedia on Confucian ethics:

>One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics). His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [allusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion), [innuendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innuendo), and even [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(rhetoric)).

in one breath he espouses the mandate of heaven in another he promotes a meritocracy for the elite.

he was not concerned with morals - he was concerned with appearances and to gain trust he had to appear moral to those who actually have morals.

sure everyone being kind is morally just - but for a political mind like Confucius encouraging morality is to create a self policing community that is simple to govern. similarly encouraging a mandate of heaven uses the holiest of holies to maintain order and stave off seditious elements.

Confucius was a monster.

there is probably a reason in china school children and principals can bow to Confucius but any kind of religious association for schools is illegal - Confucius was a political scientist who took advantage of the kindness of others to maintain order. confucian ideals as a political theory to maintain order and a self policing society hold true to this day",1,1746017863.0,3

1k8z5d7,mpa82c6,t3_1k8z5d7,ryokan1973,"Many existing popular translations of Chinese texts suffer from fundamental misunderstandings due to the translator's lack of knowledge of the language or, indeed, having no understanding of Classical Chinese at all. Consequently, these translations frequently invent or omit entire words and sentences in an attempt to enhance comprehension, which results in a significant distortion of Laozi's original words and intentions.

To address this issue, I advocate for a more balanced approach. A skilled translator should possess a deep understanding of Classical Chinese and a deep knowledge of all the rival philosophical schools (especially Ruism) in the Warring States period of pre-Qin China, allowing them to remain faithful to the original meanings and intent while eschewing excessively literal translations that risk obscuring Laozi's profound wisdom. Additionally, engaging with high-quality commentaries alongside the text can greatly enhance the reading experience.

I recommend you read this downloadable PDF translation that achieves this balance of accuracy and readability, accompanied by insightful commentaries that illuminate the text’s depth. The translator also has a background in martial arts:-

1k8z5d7,mpi4ge1,t3_1k8z5d7,Delicious_Block_9253,"**TLDR:** watch the Benebell Wen Youtube videos I linked, read the Addiss/Lombardo translation, and/or read the Ames and Hall translation (especially intro and commentaries) if you're up for some technical language. Read the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/) article. Skim through what I've written below and see if there's anything else that piques your interest.

**My biggest recommendation** is to check out Benebell Wen'a YouTube channel. Start [here](https://youtu.be/ad54Mpm5UX0?si=0nKg5siCVd8cns6R) and [here (Wu Wei - Taoist Non-Action)](https://youtu.be/TzAFobogs3Q?si=4Dlutm5xCm7N3mjQ).

Whatever sources you use, focus on some of the following core ideas:
- Dao (Tao)
- De (Virtue)
- Wu Wei (Non-action)
- Ziran (Naturalness)
- Yin and Yang
- Pu (Uncarved Block)
- Qi (Vital Energy)
- The Sage

**Reading the Dao De Jing:**
It's not expected to be easy. It's poetic, so it takes work to get the meaning. As discussed in its first chapter, it's trying to explain something beyond words, so it has to be paradoxical and confusing at times, because words can't describe reality perfectly - reality isn't words. It helps to also have a meditation practice. If you don't understand something, stop reading and sit with that line. Think about multiple layers of meaning. Go slowly, maybe even just one chapter a day/sitting. Also, know that the language it is written in is so old that much of the meaning has been lost to changing character meanings, forgotten mythologies, common sayings that aren't around anymore etc. (but scholars often do a great job of figuring things out!). Basically, even PHDs who only study this one text are often confused too - whether its because they're also missing info, or because parts of the DDJ are *meant* to be ambiguous or have multiple meanings, or because any attempt to describe something beyond words is going to be confusing and fall flat in some ways. It's a book that can be interpreted as a manual for meditation, practical advice for life, a handbook for ruling a country, etc. so as you read, think about how you can apply advice/metaphors to your own life. To some degree, it's folk wisdom that's *meant* to have multiple interpretations and applications. Try to discuss with others to exchange understanding whether on here, in person, etc. learning is social! Consider making art about it, especially some of the rich images! If you're not averse to AI, I've found pasting a line in, turning on internet search mode, and asking ChatGPT to tell me about different interpretations helps a lot. It often searches chinese language blogs/books too!  

**Translation Options:**
Addiss and Lombardo is faithful but also accessible. I think it's my recommendation based on your post.
Ames and Hall is my favorite translation, and has very very useful commentaries, but uses lots of technical language. Probably the best intro and best commentaries out of any I've read.
Avoid Mitchell. He's dishonest and misrepresents the book. It's like he's getting it wrong on purpose.
Le Guin is decent and owns that it's not a translation, but if you pick Le Guin only use it as a supplement to something else. Definitely check out her other books though - one of my favorite authors and has Daoist ideas woven throughout.
Almost all of the other major translations are solid too, and its definitely great to compare multiple.
Source: have read ~10 translations and the text in Classical Chinese.

**I Ching and Zhuangzi** are two other good texts to check out as a beginner. I Ching can be even more poetic/hard to interpret. Zhuangzi has some parts that are more straightforward. Both can be found for free online, but my favorite translations are Benebell Wen for the I Ching and Brook Ziporyn for the Zhuangzi.

**Secondary books/overviews:** Mentioned above, but the intro to the Ames and Hall translation is one of the best overviews I've ever read. Articles on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy are great, go through ones that are interesting, and maybe start [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/). Tao of Pooh is okay but not always quite on point and the author has some wild ideas (even more obvious if you read the sequel). I like Alan Watt's the watercourse way. Good intro, very readable, philosophically accurate, had input (and was actually finished) by actual Daoists. You can find Alan Watts lectures on Daoism on YouTube that are generally quite accurate and easy to understand.

**Youtube:** Religion for Breakfast ([Daoism Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHsXddZFR9AMEFx_uyGN-ZMMeD37WAJvh&si=J3tCeD04CwyUH3XF), including videos like What is Daoism, understanding Wu Wei, ""Qi"" Explained: Ancient, Mystic Superpower? etc.) and Lets Talk Religion ([What is Daoism](https://youtu.be/fTPxh6Sn_gI?si=sB0sCEAo1tHAi8eX) [The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove](https://youtu.be/ODBMOCs1xe0?si=eIyCjVAcKNFFQ5o8) [Zhuangzi - The Sage of Uncertainty](https://youtu.be/KumY4dthQ4k?si=cqmGXYTc9wDDKCBm) [Internal Alchemy in Daoism](https://youtu.be/XcuNwDyFmkc?si=sEOVnSTnijWLA5-P)) and George Thompsom ([Taoism Explained by a Taoist Master](https://youtu.be/kij4kKSGzCE?si=1-3eDH2cJRb1niA9) [The Yin Yang](https://youtu.be/JJNEvjwipO0?si=DE6v8RuSNDTK--v3) [Zhuangzi Explained](https://youtu.be/piCfNls5gqE?si=FNTQf1DHPWt5OQk2)) have some great videos, more than just the ones linked.

**Compare to Other Philosophy:** Comparative philosophy/religion can deepen your understanding. Any mystical tradition has some overlaps (Sufism, Rumi, The Conference of the Birds, Christian mysticism, Neoplatonism, a lot of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, any animist tradition, etc.). Some good books are Non-Duality by David R Loy, Zen Flesh Zen Bones, The Spectrum of Consciousness, Wild Mind Wild Earth our Place in the Sixth Extinction, Sand Talk, Japanese Death Poems, anything by Nietzsche are all good books that directly or indirectly helped me understand Daoism. It's important to not conflate different traditions beliefs, but hearing people from all of the world express similar ideas in different ways helped me understand Daoism much better. In ancient Western philosophy, Stoicism (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus are good starting places) has some overlap. Heraclitus has a TON of overlap. Jung, Heidegger and Deleuze and many other modern thinkers draw on Daoism.

Daoism wasn't born in a vacuum, and is a lot more than just one text. Consider learning more about Confucianism, Buddhism (especially Chan aka Zen aka Thien which was heavily influenced by and influenced Daoism - Thich Nhat Hanh has great books for this), Chinese folk religion/mythology, Chinese poetry, internal alchemy, Chinese medicine, etc. Historically and today, many people practicing/following Daoism were/are also Buddhists/Confucians, had/have local religious beliefs, may practice divination and meditation, etc.",3,1745856412.0,0

I once got some flak from orthodox Taoists who became very irate that my version of the “Tao Te Ching” was not a translation, that I would take off at certain points and throw the original out the window and do variations on the original theme.

And the dragons of the shui (water) ride the qi that is absorbed into the flows of water, and are the life force within their water. 

Thus the principle and its naturalness is revealed. 

The spiritual dragons are the same. What distinguishes them from each other is the nature of the current they embody. 

Wang Liping, a Quan Zhen Longmen Pai adept who was taught by three daoist wayfarers, taught a meditation retreat in Russia, and someone recounted what happened. 

Heavy rain was forecast. And the retreat required doing work outdoors for some of it. The participants were sad that they might not be able to learn this work. Wang Liping said he would talk to the dragons about this. So he did, and the next day he said that they agreed to comply so that there would be no rain. There was no rain. 

In communicating with the dragons, he worked with the spirit of the weather currents. Expressing the need, and seeing if there was a path for them to accommodate that need by flowing in some other way. Such things are not to be forced, and yet if there is a way to harmoniously negotiate with the currents, such that harmony is preserved, then perhaps a way is found, or perhaps not. In connecting with the spirit of these currents, one taps into their divine nature and does not need to try to manipulate the currents forcefully. The spirit of these currents thus become known as dragons. 

So, what current does Shenloong embody? There you find Shenloong's nature and Shenloong's truth. 

As a representative of the currents that govern spiritual flow, Shenloong is part of the continuity of many of the other dragons, but more importantly is part of their link to heaven and continuity with the Heavenly Dragon, Tianloong, and is part of the web of currents that harmonize all spiritual flow throughout the universe.",6,1745764645.0,0

There are multiple pathways to heal the soul. We can take the lessons of the universe as a path. Or we can take stillness as a path. Either way, the soul is healed through the pressures that bring it back into its unified state, to attain some relative degree of freedom. 

Freedom from the gravity of the earthly realm to return to the heavenly realm is but one of the layers of freedom that those who do their spiritual healing work within the gravities here are capable of.

Destiny is simply our state within cause and effect. It binds us to some degree, and to some degree we have free will to bind ourselves further, or to unbind ourselves. Unbinding ourselves is what leads us to some degree of spiritual freedom.

1k9196f,mpbv7y9,t1_mpbnudh,az4th,"Jeffrey Yuen is a Quan Zhen daoist priest whose grandfather taught him from the Jade Purity sect and also holds lineage from the Longmen Pai sect. 

The way he explains it is via the lens of the hun ling (ethereal soul), the po ling (the corporeal/conscious soul), and the shen ling (the spiritual soul). 

The ethereal soul stores our memories.

The consciousness soul houses the mental constructs of our conscious ego-self.

When we die, if the hun ling and the po ling and the shen ling are not all one, then they separate from each other. 

If they separate:

* The corporeal soul returns to the earth with the weight of the unfinished business it was holding.

* The ethereal soul releases to the low levels of the spirit, along with its memories from this lifetime.

* The spiritual soul witnesses the memories, and reacts accordingly to create the spiritual curriculum for the next spiritual journey. When that spiritual soul is able to re-embody in life on earth again, it will continue with the curriculum it has. But until it is able to fully unify the heavy and light parts of its soul that form anew and are gathered in the lessons of old, it cannot attain its spiritual freedom. 

Spiritual freedom is granted by accomplishing this spiritual work. 

Stillness gathers spirit to us, and it gathers as we accomplish our spiritual curriculum. This spirit comes to us in the form of energy, information, and spiritual guides and helpers, who are drawn to us by the gravity of our spiritual work. 

In this way, what you say about spiritual freedom begin granted by sentient entities is resonant. They become drawn to us and work with us, and are part of the inherent nature of spiritual truth that determines how the curriculum is accomplished, and if not, what remains to be accomplished. 

They do not have the ability to change what is written, however. They simply flow with natural spiritual truth, and cannot deviate from natural spiritual law. They cannot bend any rules for us, and their judgment of us is impartial in every way. If we do the work, they help us. If we hope for some miracle that deviates from spiritual law, well they can't do anything about that. 

So yes, spiritual truth and spiritual reality is what decides the fate of our souls. 

It is based upon the accomplishment of our spiritual curriculum.

> Apparently Lu Dongbin killed Huangloong! But not the form of Huangdi, or a representation of Wuxing, but a Buddhist monk who happened to be a yellow loong.

I resonate with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/4yl4k5/lu_dongbin_battle_and_enlightenment_with_monk/) version of the story, which resonates more with the transmitted teachings of Lu Dongbin.

> There is also an interesting story from the Buddhist tradition called Lu Dongbin Unleashes his Sword to Cut Down Huanglong (呂洞賓飛劍斬黃龍 Lu Dongbin Feijian Zhan Huanglong). It was told by Zen Master Hsu Yun (虛雲 Xuyun), an enlightened master universally recognized by all Chinese Buddhists as being the greatest Zen monk of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not uncommon for Taoists and Buddhists to run into one another in the vast religious landscape of ancient China, and this was one of those encounters. The legend is about how Zen Master Huanglong enlightened Lu Dongbin who, up until their meeting, still suffered from egoism even though he was already a Taoist transcendent. It is said that out of all the Eight Immortals, Lu Dongbin was one of the wildest ones. At one time, he was flying over a Zen monastery located on Lushan and showing off his powers. He observed a purple cloud over the monastery which indicated that something deeply sacred was occurring beneath it. Lu Dongbin wanted to see what was going on, so he transformed himself into a Buddhist monk and entered the main hall of the monastery. The abbot, Zen Master Huanglong, was about to deliver a teaching, but he stopped and said, “I will not give my discourse today because there is a Dharma thief in our assembly.” Lu Dongbin then changed back into his actual form and stepped forward. He arrogantly asked the master, “Please explain to me what is meant by the Buddhist saying ‘A grain of corn can contain the universe, and mountains and rivers can fit into a small cooking pot.’” Zen Master Huanglong laughed and called him a “corpse guarding demon” (i.e. one who is attached to his physical body which is actually something impermanent). Lu Dongbin did not understand that the actual nature of all phenomena is characterized by emptiness. He still held onto the erroneous view that the self was something real and permanent. Lu Dongbin told Huanglong, “My gourd is filled with the elixir of immortality.” Huanglong then said “Even if you are able to live for eighty thousand (i.e. countless) aeons, you still cannot avoid falling into the void!” This angered Lu Dongbin so he unleashed his magical sword and threw it at Huanglong. The Zen master merely pointed his finger at the sword and it dropped to the ground. Lu Dongbin attempted to retrieve his sword but it wouldn’t move. He was astonished that a Zen master could be so powerful. He dropped to his knees in respect and pleaded with Huanglong to enlighten him. Huanglong then explained that the mind that gives form to what it labels “a grain of corn” is the same mind that gives form to what it labels “the universe.” All things and concepts are actually mind-created. To attain true enlightenment, one must relinquish all mental fabrications which include concepts, judgments, differentiations, opinions, and ego. Lu Dongbin pondered on this profound teaching and became awakened. He was thereafter also made a Dharmapala (guardian of the Buddhist teachings).

This continues our conversation nicely. 

Returning to Heaven, and returning the soul to its heavenly state - something of the utmost of yang, the golden elixir - is only part of what is possible. It is a return to the potency of pure energy. 

But it is still divided from the other half of itself that it originally came from. 

The received Gu San Fen tells us a version of the cosmological unfolding that I rather resonate with:

Clear Qi not yet rising,  
Unclear Qi not yet sinking,  
Drifting Shen (spirit/godliness) not yet Ling (embodied as a soul),  
The Five Hues not yet divided.  

Existing within this phenomena,  
Darkness, obscurity, and yet Xing (innate nature) is present,  
This is named Hun Dun (inchoate chaos).   

Hun Dun manifests the Great Inception.  

As for the Great Inception,  
It is sprouts and new beginnings of this preeminent womb,  
Great Inception's numeric is ONE,  
ONE manifests Tai Ji (The Great Pole/Extremity - the Big Bang),  
As for Tai Ji,  
It is due to being Heaven and Earth's mother and father.  

ONE is the Pole of Change,  
Heaven is exalted and luminous and therefore clear,  
Earth is widespread and capacious and therefore unclear,  
This is named Great Change.  

As for Great Change,  
It is due to Heaven and Earth's activated changing,  
Great Change's numeric is TWO, 
TWO manifests duality,  
As for duality,  
It is due to yin and yang's manifested forms,  
This is named Great Birth.  


Because of this, attaining the golden elixir and the ability to return to heaven, one has negotiated the division between living and dying. But not between being and non-being. 

Lu Dongbin needed to learn that his attainment was not complete. 

And in this version of the story (the only one I've read about), he was humbled by Huangloong and learned that he had more cultivation work to do, so that he could return his yang to its true source in dao prior to the existance of heaven.",5,1745772567.0,0
1k90wff,mpdq2gk,t1_mpdc3cj,Lao_Tzoo,"The short story is the Taoist was impressed with himself and his attainment.

He took the ""idea"" of attainment too seriously and created, in his mind, an idea of attainment and then decided he had accomplished something of true value. 

Then, he enjoyed going around showing off to everyone, essentially,in his mind, saying, ""Everyone, look at me and my attainment! Aren't I wonderful!"" 

The Zen Master informed him he was full of bs and too impressed with himself.

He told him he was still trapped by a game of his own ego creation and thinking it actually meant something. 

He told the Taoist, even his pretend attainment is an impermanent game created by his mind, and it was this action of his mind that kept him trapped. 

He was trapping himself.

When the Taoist recognized it was all mind playing with mind and not real, he was realeased from the trap of his own construction and became truly free.

1k90wff,mpfo2fp,t1_mpcpeyp,az4th,"So in the west Akashic Record reading is just the name that stuck. I seems to have originated from Theosophy yes, but became more popularized by Edgar Cayce and his prophetic work, and the name became something that was used by people who followed, regardless of their religious backgrounds. 

As Jeffrey Yuen revealed, this is just something someone who is adept in shen gong - spiritual work - can do. And it is done just by opening up the records of something. 

The way I was a taught, we could go to a spiritual hall of records, and be asked to be shown anything. By the time I shared Jeffrey's explanation with my teacher, they were already just accessing the records directly themselves. 

Let's see, you mentioned this in your edit, after I had agreed with the first part:

> I was taught that our actions in aligning our nature with that which is desired by the gods results in the gods granting us a place amongst them... or not.

> e: in the shangqing school of taoism it was said if you read the texts 10000 times you will assuredly have cultivated the way and will certainly become immortal.

> so this is not an isolated teaching if it was also taught in Shangqing that cultivation was the path.

So the first part is the important part, and different schools will have different approaches to this. I am not as familiar with Shang Qing work. The concept you are referring to, seems to be reading the Dadong Zhenjing 10,000 times and allowing one to attain immortality without cultivation of the golden elixir. The process is described [here](https://en.daoinfo.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Book_of_the_Great_Grotto_of_the_Highest_Clarity). It resonates in principle with what I described earlier about what would be necessary in order to gain the aid of deities to help one with the work.

But to me, the work is still ultimately the same. The work one does to call down dieties into the various organs, vs the work to cultivate spiritual flow through the organs - they are both accomplishing the same elixir in the end.

Whether neidan, or this ShangQing work, there are a lot of parts to navigate. But if we're thinking about it all, then the mind gets in the way, so the mind needs to learn about these things then be clear of them. In the end, the process is all natural, and we just need to become empty so that it is able connect and flow within us on its own - whether spirits or gods, they are the same Shen, IMO.

1k90wff,mppnkvb,t1_mphnpca,az4th,"You're welcome. 

Seeing that this path is possible, and getting results with this path, are two different things. 

With neidan it is important to find a teacher. Because we all have blind spots. And the teacher, having resolved their blind spots to see clearly, can help guide us past them, and guide us to see them ourselves. 

It is like trying to walk in a circle in the woods while blind folded. We struggle to know when we are veering from the proper turns, unless someone can help us show that our tendency, in one particular part of the circle, is to go wide. And in another part of the circle we stop turning at all for some reason. 

Only once we have resolved our imbalances and blind spots, can we begin to work reliably on our own - though in the end, doing our own work is what is required. 

Lu Dongbin is also responsible for the *transmission* of the ""Secret of the Golden Flower."" Perhaps it came through to Wang Chongyang. In any case, it is at the foundation of QuanZhen work, along with the Zhong Lu Chuan Dao Ji and the Ling Bao Bi Fa. 

It can help one develop the spiritual light that can connect with one's yuanshen (original spirit), which is the substance of the xing (inner nature) we are cultivating. 

This text says that once we are able to concentrate this light within, we just need to circulate it within and it will help us pass through all the stages of cultivation. Thus it becomes something simple. 

This is very similar to the idea of gathering the spiritual deities into one's organs. 

Because 神 shen refers to the same basic thing that is used to accomplish the work. We can refer to it as pure spiritual energy. And we can also refer to it as the spiritual entities that are part of its sentient flow in its circulation of oneness. But in the end, drawing the flow of 神 through us, helps us complete our soul. 

So in some way this is something simple. 

And you may find some success in utilizing this method - the Secret of the Golden Flower, to accomplish connection with 神. 

Wang Liping, a modern Longmen Pai Quan Zhen teacher, took some people into a retreat to work with this text, and a journalist documented that work, which is roughly translated [here](https://www.thedaobums.com/topic/37319-wang-liping-the-secret-of-the-golden-flower/). 

However, as we find, Xing work is preceded by Ming work. Why? So that the energy of the body can manifest the fuel required to concentrate the spiritual light. 

Once we have concentrated the spiritual light, we can turn it within and that spiritual light can then help to replenish the energy of the body. 

It is like working for a paycheck, but needing to eat first, so that one can show up and do the work. They mutually support each other. If one is tired, one can barely hope to think. And so first, we need to cultivate the energy of the body. There are various ways to do this. Once one is able to get into a meditative routine and concentrate the spiritual light and work with it reliably, one tends to know what is required to maintain this work. 

But generally, this is what a teacher is going to be helpful for. Few of us are innately gifted enough to be able to just show up and do this without instruction. Everyone is different and everyone has their own paths, so we may not feel resonant with what everyone does. The more accomplished a teacher is, the more their energy will feel resonant, and yet they may not be as easy to find. They are more likely to spend more time with their cultivation work, and less time in the temple greeting visitors, for example. 

All that is to example a few of the principles, as I understand them, that may be of service to you along your path. 

You are likely best served by finding yourself a Shang Qing teacher, if you want to receive and accomplish the Shang Qing methods and techniques. If you are able to work with 神 deities to accomplish your test, it may be important to know which ones to call upon in which way and so on. So being able to work from the text that was mentioned, along with the instructions of a teacher who has used its methods, may be necessary. 

If this is the right path for you, and if you are able to make solid progress with it, you will know. In general, we may find it easy to make progress with some things - up until we find ourselves navigating a blind spot. And then we may feel as though we hit a wall. So we need to figure out what to change in order to navigate past that obstruction. If we listen to the answers that show up, we may be able to find the way forward. If we can't get clarity on it, we may have to look for the answers harder, including from teachers. IMO the best teachers are the one's who we call for in our hearts. They may not always show up in the forms we expect, but their guidance tends to be true, when we learn how to listen to it. 

If you are on a path of working with 神 deities, then - as you've said - it may be the most helpful to listen to the guidance of the spiritual guides that come to you. Maybe you have developed the capacity to work with your guides already, maybe not. If not, the Secret of the Golden Flower may be helpful.

Daoism does not have an ontology of contradictions or anything absurdist.

The DDJ outlines a fine theory of knowledge and the world, nothing really to criticise though there's plenty of hard pills to swallow.

1k8yxi3,mpekbls,t3_1k8yxi3,Wildernaess,"So I had been percolating in Daoist shit for a bit over 20 years by now and found my way to a sort of soft perennialist pov on religion et al. But my academic training is in anthropology where context is everything and meaning arises or is plumbed and evolves contextually and often interdependently. Many times in my life I have come across sentiments and passages and so on that reflect Dao back at me. Sometimes they are more salient than this or that translation of DDJ or Zhuangzi.

Despite all that, I find myself disdaining lots of New Age/NAD stuff and takes and find a lot of it is performative and naively shallow -- most people dress in layers. That is, I understand your impulse. Maybe reading more context, they would become Better Daoists. But I don't think so. I think that would just be fingers pointing at fingers pointing at the moon.

The perennialist and what I identify as the Taoist in me (I miss it being ""Tao"", call me nostalgic) both find it a bit ironic that IMO you've conflated the Dao and Daoism. To understand a text as the author meant it -- DDJ and its historical context -- it is certainly true that going back to the source is important. I'm not sure it is strictly necessary to understand the mystery. It is important in all scholarship not to lose the forest for the trees, nor the reverse. To focus too much on determining orthodoxy, you risk fundamentalism. Systems thinking involves taking a step back and evaluating the context, but as Arne Naess says, ""The system begins with the immediate"" and I think there's a lot to that in relation to Dao.

You also said, ""The DDJ can be seen as posing an ultimate, possibly the ultimate, question, but the answers aren't inside the book. Being a Daoist means accepting the question and seeking the (unreachable) answer, including in adjacent works."" I agree with the first, but I would say that your use of ""Daoist"" remains nebulous and not well-specified. You've written a lot around the boundaries of what is or isn't proper Daoism; can you offer a clear definition?

Ultimately, in the sense that there are many paths up the mountain, even Daoism is just a way a seeing and it's only natural to forget that first line of DDJ in your own practice and study of it.

One of my favorite quotes about Taoism is from Tolbert McCarroll, who has a translation of DDJ and on paper sounds like exactly the kind of proto/boomer New Age Cali guy you picture -- from a community called Starcross, goes by Brother Michael, etc. He says in his preface: ""The Tao is universal. It is not Chinese. Its is found in the quest of Christian mystics, native Americans, Zen monks, desert holy men, and indeed in every culture and age in the story of the earth. Before this story began and after it ends there is the Tao. It consists of stillness and silence and it will enter into any quiet heart.”",4,1745799883.0,0

Your post reads as very privileged and aggressive. I think it's great that you've had the opportunity to read all the sources and texts you're insisting others read. If I had the time to do nothing else, reading those texts and learning a new language is all I would do.

But a lot of people have 1-3 jobs, families, and the many daily difficulties needed to just survive. As a result many people in life don't even seek to better themselves and instead choose use their spare time on watching TV. The few who do seek betterment allot what little time they have to reading the TTJ, find it resonates with them, and try to align their life accordingly. They would love to read everything you suggested, but it's difficult to make time with the other responsibilities and expectations from their jobs, kids, and families.

And speaking as someone who just started a journey into Taoism, your post is very off putting. It feels like someone saying they are a fan of Lord of the Rings only to have someone tell them they can't call themselves a fan unless they have seen all the Peter Jackson movies (extended edition with commentary), the old animated movies, read the trilogy, read the Hobbit, read the Simarilion, and gained a full understanding of the life of Tolkien including an understanding of his WWI experiences and the political factors that led to WWI. It feels like swatting someone on the nose with a newspaper for having an interest in the Tao without having devoted their life to a Taoist monastery.

From the more religious perspective where this is the simple reality of existence, it seems odd to me to believe that it could only ever be understood (and I assume practiced 'right') by people with scholarly knowledge of the deep cultural history of one particular people throughout history.

I appreciate you don't want to focus on the Dao De Jing, though I don't think you can cast it out either - and it makes the point many times over that the Dao is a universal and inescapable truth in all our lives, the Dao that can be named is not the Dao and those ignorant of the Dao find it more easily, effortless action, so on and so forth.

Maybe it depends on whether you're interested in the Dao as a universal concept that  happens to have been expressed to its fullest degree by a particular people and so has been heavily influenced by their culture, or whether you're interested in the Dao as a cultural ideology that has had huge significance within and beyond that culture.

To be clear I don't think the two can really be separated. Even if I'm studying a universal truth, I'm studying it through the perspective of a particular culture that has on top of that been translated into another language and cultural perspective. The more I know about the wider context - particularly if I can access it in the original language - the more context I have for where the 'truth' has been tinged by cultural or simply human influence.

I imagine it's the same with other religions. I don't think you can understand them without understanding the history, such as how and why the modern Christian bible has the specific scriptures it does and not others and how the Catholic Church came to hold so much power.

Claiming that you're not serious about Daoism, after all, is perfectly reasonable; Daoism (in whatever particular form) is fundamentally a philosophical technology. Why do I say that? Because in China itself, Daoism is both triumphant and subjugated; it is employed by every ideological enterprise in China, even Marxism, while not being ideologically ascendant in its pure form.

Yes, I disagree with that reading, too, though whenever I bring it up, it clearly upsets a lot of people. Also, when translators use the word ""Eternal"" with a higher case ""E"", they're imposing a lot of Western religious cultural baggage onto that word.

>""Some things I have unusual views on don't really matter like I think it's ""straw and dogs"" rather than ""straw dogs"", but the thrust is basically the same so no biggy.""

This is from Chapter 11 of the Huainanzi:-

>""Many of those who oversee affairs in the world depart from the source of the Way and its Potency, saying that Ritual and Rightness suffice to order the empire. One cannot discuss techniques with people like them. What is called “Ritual and Rightness” is the methods, statutes, ways, and customs of the Five Thearchs and the Three Kings. They are the remnants of a \[former\] age. Compare them to straw dogs and earthen dragons when they are first fashioned.

>They are patterned with green and yellow,

>wrapped with silk and embroidery,

>bound with vermilion silk,

>clothed in white and black garb.""

This might suggest that ""straw dogs"" is the correct translation, though 芻狗 can also be translated as ""Straw and Dogs"", so as you said, ""no biggy"".

>""I guess another big one is I think the DDJ is talking about Dao sure, but also sometimes the higher concept than Dao, which is merely styled Dao. Basically Xuan. I think the DDJ is about Xuan, however much Wang Bi got right or made up himself, that part I think is correct and that's unusual. (Xuan is also above Ming, and generally dao as the sort of cosmic force isn't really any more important than Ming as in I guess virtuous expressed truth?)""

Yeah, 玄學 seems to have been at the top of the hierarchy in Neo Daoism with Wang Bi, though based on my limited reading and understanding of Guo Xiang, he appears to have put ""Ziran"" 自然 at the top of the hierarchy because he staunchly rejected the metaphysical Dao and I don't recall him mentioning 玄學. For him, 自然 means that all phenomena arise ""spontaneously self-so"". This means Guo Xiang rejected a metaphysical Dao, and he also rejected cause and effect. (So the Buddhists can fuck off 🤣.)

Btw, I've only read a condensed version of the Guo Xiang commentary, so I'm happy to be corrected if I've misunderstood Guo Xiang based on my limited reading. I do plan to tackle the full commentary eventually, though it makes my head hurt, lol.

>

>""I also think yin and yang have basically nothing to do with these texts.""

Professor Paul Fischer has something interesting to say about this in his translation of the DDJ:-

>

>""Yin-Yang (陰陽): Qi, or physical energy, is often described as having two basic modalities, one active and one stable or receptive (the usual antonym to “active” is “passive,” but this carries an unfortunate negative connotation), that might be conceived as analogous to the positive and negative charges of electricity, though a better analogy might be the spectrum of temperature from hot to cold. Yin and Yang appear in the text only once, in chapter 42, but the dichotomy is implied in chapter 28 and, indeed, throughout the text. A Yin-Yang analytic is at work in cosmology, as the next key concept will show, and in anthropology, as the sixth key concept will show.

>But I think the most trenchant use of the Yin-Yang idea manifests in all of the key concepts for self-cultivation detailed here. For example, unlearning, introspection, non-contrivance, contentment are all certainly good bits of advice, but implicit in each of them is their opposite: after unlearning, there must be learning; after introspection, there must be action; non-contrivance is ideal for one’s personal life, but contrivance is necessary for one’s social and professional life; a certain degree of contentment is certainly necessary for happiness, but there are times when discontent will be crucial for beneficial change. In a world of clear Yang-specific norms and rules, there will be times—sometimes very decisive times, where fuzzy Yin contingency must contravene them. Recognising this truth, to me, is the genius of Yin-Yang thinking. (for the fifth and sixth key concepts check out the introduction to this translation in the downloadable PDF link below)""

Here’s a description: 

A Refreshing and Rethinking Retrieval of Greek Thinking presents a rereading and rethinking of Greek philosophy in an attempt to retrieve an essential thread in Greek thinking that has been covered over for many centuries – beginning with the late Greeks, then Christianity, and then rationalism – and misrepresented by mistranslations from the seventeenth century onward. Using Heidegger’s work with Greek thinking as a springboard, the book shows how the covering over of this essential thread happened.


Kenneth Maly provides a frame by which those not trained in philosophy and phenomenology of experience can grasp the wider import of this rethinking of Greek philosophy. The book delves deep into key questions, preparing readers for extensive and more technical work with the key Greek words and their meanings, hidden for centuries. It includes a significant investigation of how this task requires a different way of language, how early Western thinking mirrors non-Western Daoism and Buddhism, and how quantum physics gets to the same place in its ""philosophy,"" with an emphasis on the work of David Bohm. In doing so, the book reveals how Daoism, Buddhism, the quantum potential of quantum physics, and Heidegger’s being-beyng are all mirrored in Greek philosophy, above all in early Greek thinking.",2,1745695870.0,0

Now-a-days, when I read something it's not to learn something, it's to familiarize myself with the text. 

I now read things with a discerning eye. 

Remember, these kinds of writings are a finger pointing to the moon. They describe
what something is ""like"", not what it ""is"", with precision. 

So, for me, it's about, ""That was described, or pointed to, well!"", or, ""That could've been described more accurately, or more completely!"".

Most of the time i don't think things are completely wrong, just not as well described as it could be for modern minds.

One of the biases, many in the west bring to reading these works, is that these descriptions of Tao's processes, are ""inerrant scripture"", as opposed to one, or many, person's personal experience which is then described.

This is an artifact of Judaism, Christianity and Islam which insist their main books are the inerrant words of God. 

Many westerners tend to bring with them this bias, and commonly don't recognize they are doing so.

So, having said all of this, yes I would likely read some of this work, perhaps all of it, but no guarantees.

If it would go too far astray into incomplete description, or even if it were, ""Oh! Wow! Great Book!"" I might not read all of it.

The most impressive book I've read in years was: ""Dimension One"", by Waysun Liao and I only got about 1/3 of the way through, because all I thought the entire time was  ""Yup, that's right!"", ""That was well said!"", ""This guy knows his stuff!"" etc.

I no longer need to read this kind of information, because as can be clearly discerned from most of my writings here is that, first we learn from others, then we practice, then we share what we've learned for the benefit, hopeful, benefit of others.

1k8kuuh,mpmyjx0,t1_mpmvmg2,Lao_Tzoo,"Valid is determined not by adhering to what we 'think' we understand from previous teachings. 

This is like taking an artist's description of the scent of a rose, or a beautiful sunset, as the standard by which all other descriptions should be measured. 

This is incomplete understanding and description, because it is imposing a conformity to orthodoxy and a disregarding of Lao's Chapter One which cautions us against this very thing.

Realization and insight grows from the inside out through direct perception gained through practice and then understood through the doing and then practice describing to others. 

Learning from the outside occurs from reading and being taught by others. This form of learning encourages the conformity to an e[x]ternal standard.

Consider the difference in the description of how to surf from someone who has devoted themselves to surfing for 5 years, 20 years, 40 years and 60 years. 

There is more likely for there to be deep and meaningful insight from the ones with greater experience, over those with lesser experience, even if the longer practiced persons didn't take it as seriously as someone practicing for only 10 years. 

This is because experience means much more than we sometimes presume when we are beginning. 

This is something that has more direct meaning once we are old. 

This is also because we don't know what we don't know until we know it and this discovery occurs over time, not from solely from reading.

This does not mean beginners shouldn't write according to their experiences. 

When it comes to Tao, absolutely everything counts as practice. 

Writing our thoughts and experiences helps us and others and is also our practice.

Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would attain ataraxia. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs.""

— Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I, Chapter 12

"" ""If you ask me whether there is a next world, then if it were to occur to me (iti ce me assa) that there is a next world, I would pronounce that there is a next world. Yet, I do not say so, I do not say thus, I do not say otherwise, I do not say no, I deny the denials. Similarly with regard to the propositions.""

\-Digha Nikaya 1

Note: even the Pyrrhonists, especially modern ones on reddit and such, frequently end up taking some position or other. But, considering the usefulness of skepticism aimed at being without position, I take the above quotes as perfect solutions to these positions.

Apply them, for example, to the modern Pyrrhonist's frequent stubborn holding of relativism as a position. Though they will play word games to deny it as a position, they also will vehemently refuse to even consider that relativism might not be true, or Pyrrho forbid, that extreme relativism is incoherent.

The real goal, as I understand it, is mental peace through truly being without position. Thus, the way I read Pyrrhonist texts is that ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING in them is subject to being let go of. They are just tools, not positions, and to take them as positions is to completely misunderstand the goal of Pyrrhonism. Even if it is to embrace the exact words of some famous Pyrrhonists, it is to fail to reach ataraxia properly.

We need to be able to say, ""Your position is fallible because it can be shown as relative, and not absolutely true"" and then, just as easily say, ""The position of relativism can also be considered fallible, and so we may drop this nonsense and have lunch."" In other words, ataraxia.

Once you have this technique down, you are ready to study again safely, as you will have learned how to drop things and avoid anxiety about them. There is also much in the Chuang Tzu about being empty minded, useless, and so on that agree with at least some degree of this ataraxia goal.

1k7wpky,mp5loju,t3_1k7wpky,az4th,"> 1.What skills transcend materialism? What truths does aging unveil,especially about health, helplessness, or the quiet wisdom youth often ignores?

Before the big bang, there was undifferentiated energy. Do we call it nothing? Can it be called something, if it has no form? Formless, yet poignant. 

Then in a moment of clarity, something is distinguished from the - we may now call it - nothing. In a flash of light, there is a big bang and energy (yang, heaven), spreads out throughout this formlessness (yin, earth), throughout all the realm. 

As yang and yin mix and merge and differentiate, within these mixings parameters of what is possible unfold. We call these the four forces:


    ⚎ Minor Yang (Wood) A light and buoyant force.  
    ⚌ Major Yang (Fire) A strong force.  
    ⚍ Minor Yin (Metal) A heavy force.  
    ⚏ Major Yin (Water) An abiding force.  

And the eight trigrams, that come together as pairs of the four forces with a poignant middle:


    ☰ Qian and ☷ Kun determine the positions.  
    ☱ Marshlands and ☶ Mountains circulate qi.  
    ☳ Thunder and ☴ Wind mutually entangle.  
    ☵ Water and ☲ Fire discharge in mutual opposition.  

Thus the framework of reality becomes established, and the myriad phenomena become created in endless possibilities.

And too, there is a way, that ever reveals to us the path back to our original root in our formless source that is everything and nothing all at once. 

Within form, we discover limitations, discover division, and discover that when one part moves, all parts move. And thus we are bound. Bound to a destiny to follow the path back to formlessness, or bound to become more deeply entangled within form.

This is our free will - this is our choice. 

Our spiritual curriculum, is to unravel this binding to become complete once again. Undivided and returned to being whole. Gathered as one with heavenly light again, purely yang, so that we can steep that wholeness within the emptiness and return to the undifferentiated state. 

But to put it this way makes it feel so out of reach. It is not. It does not come from attaching to the lofty distant possibility, but from centering oneself in what is right in front of one and surrendering to simply be and follow the way where it leads. 

The course is a meandering one - it spirals - ever true, yet ever mysterious. We find it with the clarity in our heart that aligns us with our upright posture to open us to divine light from the tops of our heads. This leads to returning the conditioning of the mind to its pure state that is free of thoughts that get in the way of the divine light flowing through us, reconnecting us to source. They call this Christ Consciousness, as well as Buddha Mind, and the Mind of Dao. It is reconnection with our true self.

The way leads us all differently, as each part within the whole is unique. It is each part's destiny to return. And, despite our differences, we are all one. And the more of us begin to walk this path, the more synchronistic flows we discover that merge us all back into a great harmony. A harmony that becomes less and less divided, and more and more effortlessly leading to what is whole. 

And so we follow this way naturally. It may take many lifetimes, each one learning the lessons we are ready for as we follow. Each one, becoming more and more naturally fulfilled in the way the ego always wants us to be - if only it could find the way to get out of its own way. Thus it is simple. 

> 2.Is chakra awakening a viable path? Where to begin without dogma? How about occult learnings? 

Many paths are viable. We pick up tools for their usefulness. And then put them down again when they are not necessary. 

Can we open ourselves energetically, while simultaneously being contained energetically, with no leaks? Can we heal our traumas, eliminate the conditioning of our habit momentum, and raise the vibration of our minds? Can we come to root between heaven and earth so that we are a vessel that allows these two to spontaneously circulate within us to naturally resolve all divisions, without getting in the way? 

Nothing more is needed than this. And, we all find our way to this by stepping forward along our paths and listening to what we need to help us - listening to what tool is right for us, right now. Asking ourselves what we need to do to create more inner clarity and resolve past divisions within our bodies, our hearts, and our minds.

> 3.To those who’ve navigated similar storms, what would you tell your younger self? What milestones (spiritual or worldly) matter a lot by 30 or 40?

The celestial mechanism of change is ever churning. We go through periods of difficulty. And they are tests to see if we can avoid extremes and hold to our centers. Tests for us to let go of inner division to find greater clarity, rather than clinging to the attachments of illusion. 

All of the bindings of attachment are simply holding us away from unity. In re-leasing those attachments, in forgiving our attachment to them, whatever they may be, we re-lease the energy between us and them that is holding us apart from becoming unified as one with them again. 

Thus, all wrongness, judgment, separation and division is but illusion. 

Just as all matter is simply vibration of energy. 

In raising our vibration, we become more and more refined and able to tune into the nature of this. Until we can eventually form and unform our bodies at will. But such things happen of themselves, as needed. Powers exist, and powers cannot be attached to, or we soon lose them. Maintaining our cultivation ever depends upon being empty of that which could prevent it from flowing through. 

> 4.'Books': My Goodreads list overflows,where to start? (Drop profiles if you’re there!) A wise man told me to read biographies first. 

*Opening the Dragon Gate*

*The Tao of Health, Longevity, and Immortality*

*The Uncharted Voyage Toward the Subtle Light*

All religion leads to the same ultimate spiritual accomplishments. It is just their dogma that creates division. When we discover how to see through to their deepest truths, we get past all that which exists in division. 

A mountain top may have many paths leading up to its summit. By nature, they are all different ways. Being different, they may all contend with each other, because they are different. But so long as we can see them all as serving the right purpose for the right people, and learn that each part must follow its own path, we become immune from judging others as right or wrong. 

Principles are useful, because they are not fixed and rigid, but are malleable. 

And ultimately at their hearts they connect back to unity. 

First there is rule by law. 

Then there is rule by principle. 

The the rule of the way can naturally come into existence. 

Nature established this with the subtle balances in ecosystems that allowed ever more forms of life to co-exist. With many checks and balances, every species depended upon fitting into that balance in order to survive. This dependency cohered to spiritual development. This is why the animals, plants and trees of nature are so sensitive. They are connecting with the light and not blocking it with their minds. 

Human nature was once like this too. And yet in coming to dominate the food chain, it became divided from the demands of nature, and humanity enabled itself to fall victim to unchecked desire and greed. Such things ever discover balance yet again. But with that balance arrive as it does for a host that falls victim to its cancer? Or as the cancer that surrenders its greed to realign with the balanced way again?

One way or another, what is unsustainable, cannot sustain. 

Thus the *dao de jing* tells us:

> *No avoidable misfortune is greater than not knowing sufficiency; no failing is greater than desire.*

> *Therefore realizing sufficiency's sufficiency constantly is enduring sufficiency.*",1,1745679507.0,0

I first read about Taoism at uni, 3 years ago, in a class on Asian Cultures. We explored it pretty much from above. 

I made my first serious dive into Taoism after looking at a comment in a post from r/Stoicism about a guy worried about his admission test to uni. It's already been one year since that.

I started diving into this group and then I read the TTC.

And here I am.

At first, I was just focused on the concept of Wu Wei and used to take Lao Tzu's words a little too literally lol.

With practice and failure, I started seeing a little more in between the nuances.

I used to suffer from Insomnia since I was 19. I gradually overcame it thanks to applying the teachings of Taoism. Due to that, I was then fully convinced this was my way lol. 

Regarding the sources, I read the TTC as translated by D.C. Lau, Zhuangzi translated by Brook Ziporyn, Liezi by Iñaki Preciado, and Neiye by Harold D. Roth. 

I also read Trying Not To Try by Edward Slingerland but it is a little too academic to my taste.

They were wanting to literally whip my ass (they believed in corporal punishment) and they took my Tao away.

1k6swy4,motu9do,t3_1k6swy4,CloudwalkingOwl,"I don't know what you are studying, but the solution to the climate crisis won't come from a scientist's lab. Instead, it's a social/political problem. You mention EVs, but that's an example of what happens if you approach something from a limited viewpoint. 

The push for EVs is because capitalists feel a need to colonize the environmental movement. A much better solution would be one where city zoning changed and public transit replaced the individual automobile. I can understand how someone from a science background wouldn't understand this---he's been given a hammer and taught that every problem is a nail. 

As a Daoist, I've tried to learn (in my bones) that any solution to the Climate Emergency will probably be emergent and the result of an unconscious, collective process. For example, I've come to the conclusion that EV cars are a dead end---but the battery and motor technology that has been created for them will reap big dividends in the form of Electric Bicycles.",5,1745517437.0,0
1k6swy4,mot3ko7,t3_1k6swy4,Emmengard,"What is the “natural way?” 

Humans have been farming for thousands of years and in the process depleting the soil and causing desertification. Our destruction of the environment has sped up with the industrial revolution but we were well on our way before that. 

And at this point we are well beyond the carrying capacity of the earth if we were to return to a hunter gather way of life. Farming increases the caloric output you can expect from a given piece of land. 

So do we return to natural farming? 

But we can’t even do that, we can’t farm at the levels we need without manufactured fertilizer to replenish the nitrogen in the soil. Fritz Haber made that possible by developing a method for pulling nitrogen from the atmosphere. This has made it possible to feel billions.

[ side note cause it just blows my mind: He also developed Zyclon, the pesticide that would be altered into Zyclon B and used in the Holocaust to kill people in the gas chambers. He was also Jewish.

…His work saved billions and killed millions… we can’t control how the things we learn are used by others.]

Because of his work there is no going back without the death of billions first. 

Is it not natural for life to grow, adapt and change? If things are unbalanced then we must seek for balance, but it will necessarily be a new balancing of forces because of the long history that has carried us to this moment and altered the very forces themselves.

How can we temper our knowledge with wisdom? 

Is it not natural to want to help others, to protect others? We will do anything to protect those we love. 

We can go back but at what cost? Is it in harmony with our nature to accept that loss of human life?

Is perhaps the unnatural thing not our innovation and inquiry, but our corporate greed? Our valuation of GDP over human lives? Our reduction of a human soul to a monetary value?

Edit: wanted to add… I was just thinking about early Taoists and how they were alchemists and healers. They were early scientists! Observing and learning about the natural world is not a bad thing.",3,1745509954.0,0

Since I've started my PhD and been involved in many projects concerning climate change, I've started to feel that most of the narratives that are pushed in the ""fight against climate change"" are fallacious, or like you said, are being pushed by someone who's got something to gain from them.

What has been happening recently is that we have gone from fighting climate change, to mitigating it, and then finally most of the new projects include climate change **adaptation.** Seems to me like we are admitting that we are loosing the ""fight"" :)

Anyways this post was just my pondering about am I pursuing a futile way, and should I go on a different path. As you have said, this will in the end be determined by an unconscious, or rather subconscious process in me, when I start feeling that ""that's not it"", but I just wanted to share my thoughts with people here because I found it amusing how much Zhuangzi actually understood, with so little he could have known back in the day about these things :D",5,1745525347.0,1

We are inside of a bloom that we will also have to witness decay because decay is inevitable. The earth has had multiple mass extinctions. Sometimes because of a life form sometimes because of an “accident”. Like, I think this is just what it is and we can make decisions and we have to live with those decisions—all of us—and there is nothing we can save because nothing actually lasts. Like, life happens on timelines we can’t conceive of. This doesn’t void us of responsibility but it also makes us rather small.

1k6swy4,mouijmk,t1_mot3ko7,Maximilian-Pegasus,"Yeah when I read it all again, I can't pinpoint exactly what I have meant by returning to the natural way. Natural is very hard to define, and it is one one of the most common sources of fallacies.

For farming, it was more local and more of a closed circle before the industrialization of farming. Farmers would produce crops, feed them to livestock, and then put their manure back in the same fields they got the animal feed from. We weren't really destroying the environment in the same way that we do now. Nowadays, you farm land in Europe, export the products to North America, and get your fertilizer from phosphates found in North Africa. In this crazy globalized process, a great dis-balance is created. 

And in your sidenote about Fritz Haber, that is exactly what I fear. We cannot control what our inventions are going to be used for, same goes for the people that were involved in nuclear energy research, who were doing it to benefit humanity, and then some other folks used their research to create the most destructive weapon in history that could easily wipe out all living things from the face of the Earth. Then again, the nuclear bomb actually brought relative world peace between great powers, which reminds me of the story of the farmer, we should not be quick to judge things :)

That's a great point about corporate greed and greed in general, I think chasing the GDP numbers and being in a constant process of increasing it is one of the worst things happening to us right now, but then again, isn't all this ""natural"" too. There has always been greed in each and every era and each and every society, and when the GDP race started, there was no going back.

Since this comment itself is making excessive and ill-informed assumptions, in violation of Occam's Razor.

As a Nurse of 40 years I can guarantee that medications create side effects that require further medications to ameliorate.

Psych meds alone create more psych issues for many, or most people, which is why they tend to require more psych meds to ameliorate

The Razor of Occam cuts through complexity, but does not eliminate the complexity itself. Similarly, addressing problems may create new ones, not because problems are subjective or objective, but because the world is interconnected.

1k6swy4,mp4ec0o,t1_moson7p,GuildLancer,"SSRIs generally do not cause many side effects if any, and those that are caused many can be handled with out medicine. There are plenty of medications that don’t cause side effects needing medical intervention. 

You’re taking a somewhat biased stance based on your personal interpretation of Daoism and also your own experiences. While this isnt wrong (we are all biased and none are perfect) it does ignore parts of Daoist literature and philosophy. There is a lot more complexity to it, some have side effects depending on the individual, some are neccesssry side effects that actually help, some are major and some are minor. We have to empty ourselves, you are starched to being a nurse, attatched to your experiences and knowledge, but you must become somewhat distant from that. 

As a personal example, I take HRT. It makes me happier and makes me feel as if I am living my true self, it takes zero effort and improved my life. I haven’t had to take any other medications to alleviate anything caused by them. They can cause bone density problems, but I am fine because I drink milk and consume plenty of calcium giving things. It can cause high blood pressure but I go for walks and work out, so I don’t have that. The idea that medications always cause side effects requiring more medication isn’t true. Even in Daoism herbal medicine is often practiced, and that too can create side effects. One side effect HRT has that impacts me also is that I have grown shorter, and yet this has only made me more comfortable in my body. I have also gained a little weight despite my desire for food decreasing, this has made me more feminine. Rather than seeing medicine as bad, which it can be, there is also good in it.

However, the picture may be experienced either incrementally ""or"" all at once. 

With the incremental view the mind of the experiencer interacts with the picture as similar to an ant crawling across the picture, that is, from a narrower perspective wherein only so much of the picture may be observed at a time due to the ant's narrower perspective.

While from above, an observer of the picture perceives the entirety of the experience all at once.

In this manner the ant experiences the picture in a more linear fashion than an observer who perceives from above who perceives the picture holistically, rather than incrementally.
