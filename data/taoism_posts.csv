1kn2via,Why does this man suffer,"Tonight I took a midnight walk. I saw a homeless man in mental crisis possibly drugs. He wasn't doing well. The tao does nothing yet leaves nothing undone. Why? Why does this man suffer?

Edit more context. I offered him a cigarette he seemed appreciative. He was gyrating violently. Thought about calling an ambulance but this appeared mental not physical. He was clear in saying thank you. Had some presence of mind. I in retrospect felt guilty for not calling help. Yet there is no way the proper authorities aren't aware and uncaring or unable to help. I walked away wondering why so much violence. When I see the violence of a storm I am in awe of the universe when I see violence in a man's state it hurts me. There is no difference.

1kn6wje,"Do you ever delay on purpose, not out of fear but to let clarity come in?","Sometimes I wait before making a choice. Not because I am afraid, but because something inside me is not ready. Or it is not clear yet.  
When I move too fast, I tend to push against the moment. But when I pause, even briefly, things often settle. And when they settle, then I see more clearly.

I came across this line recently:  
""*Stillness is the foundation of awakening. Without stillness, the Way cannot enter.*""  
Wen-Tzu, Understanding the Mysteries (tr. Thomas Cleary), Chapter 25

It made me reflect: Maybe waiting is not weakness. Maybe it is wisdom, if and when done with presence.

What I’m still figuring out is this:  
How do you know if your pause is wise or if it’s quiet avoidance?  
And when you do wait, how do you sense the right moment to move again?

I’m new to this sub and haven’t read much of the taoist thought yet except of Tzu Chuang and Benjamin Hoff. I’m also not a native English speaker, so sorry if any of this will sound weirdly constructed. But what is somehow puzzling to me is this that I as much as I understand taoism focuses on effortless action and many of this is connected to focusing on basic needs, even primal, I would say, like mindful walking, meditation, movement in general. 
It led me to thinking that us all as a society made our lives complicated, like with having a job, it also made me wonder if me being an artist or a musician is really connected to taoism anymore because I don’t see the line between what is interpreted as an “effortless action” and something that just complicates life as it is.
I was curious what are your thoughts on this matter and if you could provide some insight as I’m, as I said, a beginner.",7,13,1747313707.0,yulchu
1kn7h3h,"""The man of character and the hyprocrites by Zhuangzi"" Narrated by Alan Watts","The man of character lives at home without exercising his mind and performs actions without worry. 
The notions of right and wrong and the praise and blame of others do not disturb him. When within the four seas all people can enjoy themselves, that is happiness for him. When all people are well provided, that is peace for him. 

Sorrowful in countenance, he looks like a baby who has lost its mother. Appearing stupid, he goes about like one who has lost his way. 

He has plenty of money to spend and does not know where it comes from. He drinks and eats just enough and does not know where the food comes from. This is the demeanor of the man of character.


Then, by contrast:


The hypocrites are those people who regard as good whatever the world claims as good, and regard as right whatever the world claims as right. 

When you tell them that they are men of Tao, then their countenance is changed with satisfaction. When you call them hypocrites, then they look displeased. All their lives they call themselves men of Tao, and all their lives they remain hypocrites.

 They know how to give a good speech and tell appropriate anecdotes in order to attract a crowd. But from the very beginning to the very end they do not know what it’s all about. 
They put on the proper garb and dress in the proper colors and put on a decorous appearance in order to make themselves popular, but refuse to admit they’re hypocrites. Torn.",8,3,1747313676.0,Aggressive-Cause-208

Xinyang’s Upadhyaya [Qing]rang, because a monk asked: “When *Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Buddha*^1 sat in *bodhimanda*^2 for ten kalpas, the Buddha-dharma manifests not before [us], there is no attainment of the accomplishment/becoming of Buddha’s way, what of it?”

[Qing]rang said: “What’s asked is rather appropriate/fitting/correct.

>僧云。既是坐道場。為甚麼不得成佛道。讓曰。為伊不成佛。

The monk continued: “Since it is a sitting in bodhimanda, why is there no attainment of the accomplishment/becoming of Buddha’s way?”

[Qing]rang said: “Because he does not accomplish-to/become Buddha.”

1kmpulu,The Lethani comes from the same place as laughter.,"I figured it out, I've been trying to live via perspective and detatchment, to do what i think is right in the moment and let it be, but I keep getting bogged down in my avoidant tendencies (like reddit)

Then the question becomes what is right? I'm definitely not correct all the time, especially when I'm engaging with avoidant behavior, but I find that usually I'm right. Like I know I should wash the dishes and do my work, my salience is pretty reliable.

Anyway last night I had an epiphany. Suddenly it hit me, the lethani (right action and knowing right action) comes from the same place as laughter. That is to say, my gut is usually right.

1kmc0am,Is there a view on criteria when choosing a romantic partner?,"Attractivness was not an important criteria for me when I met my wife. I used to think it's a shallow criteria and not important for a relationship.

But now 12 years later the fact that I don't find my wife attractive is starting to annoy me more and more. 

She's not even objectively unattractive, she's just not my type.

The other annoying thing that's hard to get over is how family oriented she is. She has a big family and literally every other weekend there's a family gathering for someone's birthday or wedding or something other reason and I always disliked big family gatherings and it's exhausting for me.

Other than that we have a lot of respect and understanding for each other despite our differences.
We strive to put together a good relationship and in many -if not most- aspects, i think it's pretty healthy.

But I am tormented with thoughts of breaking up in order to find something better for both of us.

1klteb1,"How do I reconcile giving up control, with my duties as a parent?","I'm reflecting on the 29th verse. 
Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?
I do not believe it can be done.

The universe is sacred.
You cannot improve it.
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;
Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.

Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.


To me it seems to be all about giving up control, trusting in the perfection of the universe and recognizing cycles.

I've been struggling ever since I picked up the text with the seeming contradictory nature of letting go, but also raising safe, kind, and grateful children.

How much danger do I allow them to take?
I can't serve them without spoiling them. 

I'm I just supposed to trust in the Tao within me to guide me? 

It's all very difficult to wrap my head around the concept of trusting God, relinquishing control and raising good kids. I know they ""aren't my kids"" but according to the state they are so I'm responsible for them.

1kknzlb,An interesting extra line in some source versions of Tao Te Ching 57,"The last part of chapter 57 in the Tao Te Ching goes:

>故聖人云： And thus do sages say:
>
>我無為而民自化， we don't attempt deliberate control, and the people transform/adapt of their own accord;
>
>我好靜而民自正， we are fond of peace and quiet, and the people sort things out of their own accord;
>
>我無事而民自富， we don't interfere, and the people get prosperous of their own accord;
>
>我無欲而民自朴。 we don't (give in to) desire, and the people simplify of their own accord.
>
>**我無情而民自清。 We don't surrender power to emotions, and the people purify of their own accord.**
>
>(ad hoc translation by me)

That last line appears only in some versions of the Chinese text, and I'm not sure which official recension is the source. Very few if any translations include that line. At the very least, it seems to be a compact paraphrase of Heshang Gong's commentary which says under the desire & simplify line (translated by Dan G. Reid): 聖人言：**我**修道守真，絕去六**情**，**民自**隨我而**清**也。 ""The sage says 'I cultivate Dao and hold onto reality (by) cutting off and discarding the six emotions. The people then follow me of their own accord and become pure.'""

Note by Reid: ""The six emotions are: like 好 (hao), dislike 惡 (wu), excitement 喜 (xi), anger 怒 (nu), sorrow 哀 (ai), and pleasure 樂 (le).""

Do you think the additional line accords with the rest of Lao Tzu's teachings?

1kk9fjz,I wrote this short piece after reading the Tao Te Ching when feeling very inspired. I hope it's not too long to read.,"Dwell in the moment, for it is only in the moment that you are truly alive.

The past exists as but memories, fleeting, and unsubstantial.

The future exists as but aspiration and fear, both of which the sage does not attend to.

What you see and what you hear, these exist only in the moment, the only place you are truly alive

Something is considered small when in contrast with something larger (than it)

That same small thing is considered large when compared with something smaller than it.

Something is considered masculine when it is compared with something that is feminine.

All things acquire their attributes when in contrast with something that (seem to)

lack these attributes.

It is in this way that all things are defined.

It is in the definition of a thing that it springs forth from Tao.

The deep mystery of the Tao is the spark of Creation itself.

All beings think and feel, as do you, therefore do not speak or act in a manner that is harmful to others.

If you do not speak or act in a way that is harmful to others, others will speak and act towards you in a way that is peaceful and kind.

This is done not out of any obligation, but for the sake of peace, kindness, and compassion themselves.

For we all wish to be happy.

And we all wish not to suffer.

Our intentions shape our actions, our actions shape our reality.

Be mindful of these, for every action is a step in a certain direction.

Of all paths, to stand still amidst all desire is the path to peace of mind.

What is empty is capable of being filled with any (kind of) thing.

An empty mind is open and receptive to those around (the owner) of it.

Let not ceaselessly think on this thing and think on that thing, for much pondering leads to confusion and a lack of peace.

Confusion and a lack of peace lead to many troubles.

One dwelling looking outward will be lively.

One dwelling looking inward will be resolute.

Your inner world is a reflection of your outer world.

Cleanse within to cleanse without.

Desire is what leads to a manifestation of the Tao.

A lack of desire is what leads to the subtleties of the Tao.

As time passes, through the will of men, Earth, Heaven do all things manifest.

Yet the Tao is neither above any of these.

The Tao has no will of its own, and in this way, in a sense, it both creates things and allow things to return to it.

Having no will, is it not in this way that everything is accomplished?

If only man could be so inclined to (imitate) the Tao!

Patience is the virtue which allows for the witnessing of all things springing forth and returning to the Tao.

For all things have a beginning and an end, and patience allows the time passing between beginning and end to pass by smoothly, without any attachment.

Patience knows that all which rises, falls, and does not claim to take unnecessary part in this process.

The virtue of peace is very near to the way of the Tao.

For with peace, there is no going too far in either direction, and when there is this, there is no one thing prized above anything else.

Therefore, dwell in the unfathomable abyss of the Tao and you will find peace.

All things are in a state of change.

They are born, they exist for awhile, and then they pass away.

If it is so, then do we let go, for we know they will pass away?

Or do we cherish them, for we know they will pass away?

What if we were to cherish them as they cherish themselves? So that in death, we can let go of them as they let go of themselves.

All things proceed along nature’s course, until they arrive at their end.

When one tries to meddle in affairs of nature (or otherwise) their meddling works against the natural course of things.

It is better neither to be for nor against, abandoning like and dislike and let things arrive at their end of their own accord.

What harm is done, from liking this thing disliking this other thing? (indeed much!)

Pleasure and pain, loss and gain, praise and blame, fame and obscurity.

These all seem to be conditions which ought to be feared.

You must know pleasure to know pain.

You must know loss to know gain.

You must know praise to know blame.

You must know fame to know obscurity.

Being indifferent to these conditions and suffering falls away and into the abyss of the Tao.

If every moment was treated as a new beginning, what end would there be in sight?

Be a friend and have only friends.

Be an enemy and have only enemies.

We are all mirrors one to another.

If we are kind, we will receive kindness.

Can one not one take advantage of another, when all is said and done?

If we are cruel, will only cruelty arise?

Or can it be called fair?

This is a mystery I know not.

Sometimes things are good.

Sometimes things are not.

Be wise and discern in every situation, the right course of action.

For it is not about (always) refraining from this thing, and (always) doing this other thing.

Guided by wisdom and truth, one always acts appropriately.

One who makes the Tao his business, makes his desires few, makes his words even fewer, and chooses not to act in all circumstances when appropriate and only with stillness in mind.

In this way he diminishes and diminishes all thought, word, and action until a sublime peace is obtained. A wisdom without words and acting without intention is attained.

This is but the natural man, in his simplicity. 

It was said of old, he is the noblest of all under Heaven.

What is truth?

Truth is before you.

Words can capture truth, yet there is not one phrase that can capture all of truth.

Therefore truth is before you, truth is in the sunshine, in the moonlight, in trees and in the sound of birds.

There are those who claim to know the truth.

Yet if one in need is left in need by them, then how do they know the truth?

Should not an adherence to God overshadow any Teaching of men?

If you claim to know the truth and leave the hungry hungry, the homeless homeless, and care not for the welfare others, how much more a hypocrite are you than those creating an adherence of God and the Teachings?

The aim is not to understand or not understand, because whether you do or not, things are the way they are.

The aim is to act or not act, respective to the situation.

Sometimes its best to let things be.

Sometimes its best to take action.

Did not Jesus Himself heal on the Sabbath Day?

1kjz77j,Dao De Jing Interpretation by Ron Hogan (2004),"From Hogan's Introduction:

...

Once I thought I had a rough idea what was behind the words, though, I went about rephrasing the chapters in my own voice. My guiding principle was to take out as much of the ""poetry"" as possible, to make the text sound like dialogue, so the reader could imagine someone telling him or her what Tao's all about. You can't take the ""poetry"" out completely, because the TTC is always going to have those lines about Tao being an ""eternal mystery"" and whatnot. But the beauty of the book isn't in its language, at least not for me--it's in the practical advice Lao Tzu offers us about how to live a productive, meaningful life on a day to day basis. What I wanted to do was to make that advice as clear to a modern American reader as it would have been to the guard who first asked Lao Tzu to write it down.

...

Examples

Laozi 7

Tao never stops. Why? Because it isn't trying to accomplish anything. The Masters hang back. That's why they're ahead of the game. They don't hang on to things. That's how they manage to keep them. They don't worry about what they can't control. That's why they're always satisfied.

Laozi 8

""Doing the right thing"" is like water. It's good for all living things, and flows without thinking about where it's going ...just like Tao. Keep your feet on the ground. Remember what's important. Be there when people need you. Say what you mean. Be prepared for anything. Do whatever you can, whenever it needs doing. If you don't compare yourself to others, nobody can compare to you.

Laozi 63

Keep still. Don't work so hard. Learn to appreciate everyday life. Pay attention to details. Start small and work your way up. When people give you trouble, let it slide. Break everything down to its essentials. Get the job done before it becomes a chore. With the right preparation, difficult tasks can be completed with ease; every major project consists of simple steps. The Masters don't take on more than they can handle, which is why they can do just about anything. Don't promise more than you can deliver, and don't underestimate the task: You'll only make things harder for yourself. The Masters are always aware of the difficulties involved, which is why they never have to deal with them.

1kjt5ii,"Verse 1 and trying to ""understand"" Taoism","Salutations! 

This is the first time I have taken time to reflect on the Tao Te Ching. In the past, I've scrolled past through verse and picked apart phrases and sentences that had resonated with me and reflected an event that happened in my life. This picking apart served me well for the situation, so I thought to myself, why not try to understand what's the buzz with Taoism and the ""way"".

I sat inside my room, with my three translations of the Tao Te Ching (Stephen Mitchell's, Jonathan Star's, and Gia Fu Feng's) and started reading the first verse. Going through the first couple of sentences was a breeze. As I have interpreted it, humans cannot understand the ""Tao"" simply because we are not future-seeing aliens who knows it all and stressing things out of our control will simply lead to stress and anxiety. ""All right, I get it."" I told myself. I seemingly ""understood"" the Tao and its essence.

However, the next couple of sentences puzzled me. ""What's all this about emptying your mind?"", I stressed. And so I scrolled through articles and explanations about the verse 1 and tens of other interpretations from articles, reddit threads, and the second page of Google results. I begin to shake my legs, with small sweat beads on my forehead, just trying to understand what ""emptying your mind"" means.

The idea then struck me that this might be an exercise, as in emptying your mind, not trying to know anything but simply going through it as it is. The right mindset in reading the Tao Te Ching is not the ""getting to the bottom of this"" mindset but more like ""chilling in your room and reflecting"".   
  
Stressing myself on things I want to know on a concept being unnamable and mysterious seems silly, but that is maybe how our brains work. As humans, we try to seek patterns, and seek answers, then we can control something and manipulate it to our advantage. Taoism taught me today, of letting go of such desire, not to push and stress, but to stay still.

Thank you for reading this! That's my experience with reflecting on the Tao Te Ching for the first time. I'm still halfway through the first verse.

1kj4qah,"Seeking insight on Taoist elements in Kagurabachi - significance of hishaku, hand tattoo, Big Dipper, bracelet and mudras?","Hi everyone, I’ve been reading the manga Kagurabachi and noticed it seems to reference several Taoist symbols or practices. 

Specifically, I’m curious about the possible significance of: 
•	the organization named hishaku (meaning ladle) •     the hand tattoo 
•	the Big/Northern Dipper 
•	and the hand mudras or gestures used in rituals or combat
•     bead bracelet 

I’m not sure how accurately these reflect Taoist traditions, or if they’re more artistic adaptations. Could anyone more knowledgeable than me share context or interpretations from a Taoist perspective? I’d love to understand the symbolism better.

Also on the off chance anyone here also reads it and has noticed anything else that would be amazing.

1kjir3b,My interpretation of Tao Te Ching chapter 2,"One of the quotes that I found to stand out from the second chapter is ""Difficult and easy complement each other"". At first, it seems like the ideas of difficulty and easiness are contradictory since we deem things that are hard as not easy. However, they go together in a couple of ways. First, things that are hard become easy via habits that become more automatic. Secondly, things that are hard can be made easier by going with the flow and working with your natural rhythm rather than forcing effort just for the sake of putting in more effort.

I'm learning to Unlearn what I've learn so that I can learn what I haven't learn.

There's no distance or closeness between it or me so why compare.

It began the moment I first breathed — and ended the moment I realized there is nothing to reach. But it never ends, because every step I take is the Way unfolding itself through Me.

To walk and not walk. To begin without beginning. To arrive without destination.

1kh0zbb,Just don’t hold the breath meditation,"Hey guys I’ve been practicing breathe awareness technique and been trying to do it all day. One of a new cue that I’ve been following is the cue of “just don’t hold the breath”. Now let me explain what this means and why it’s useful. What it’s doing is keeping ur attention on breath as ur not trying to hold the breath so ur essentially just watching it / allowing the breath really. If u find urself holding it then that’s ok just watch that and watch ur body breath again. So it’s not in the literal sense where ur like not holding it as u can’t control that physically, the cue is intending you to essentially maintain a continual watching/ allowing which is much easier throughout the day and literally takes up little to no cognitive resource, allowing u to do this all day regardless of what ur doing (talking studying driving working etc). You may say, well why not have “breath watching all day” as the cue then? Well that’s a good point but i think this “just don’t hold ur breath” is simpler and makes it easier to do all throughout the day besucase its not really about consciously guiding the breath or in and out breath, but really just allowing it , maintaining attention but not in a cognitive way if that makes sense I really love this practice and what to see if anyone is like minded and is doing soemthing similar and can explain what I mean ",1,3,1746633607.0,alevelmaths123

Now I don’t necessarily mean the air through the nostrils but just any sensation u feel of breath in the body, and that being the truth. Breath is spirit. I truly believe breath is the answer, not in any particular breath work or way or breathing but simply the act of watching/noticing/feeling it. Now I know lots of people will disagree saying it’s only 1 object but I believe it’s the only true way to enlightenment.

1kgcqdl,Waidan (external alchemy),"So has anyone heard of Lu Dongbin?

Widely accepted in Taoism as man who transcended the mundane, he delegitimised Waidan and introduced Neidan, truly focussing on self cultivation rather than a chemical approach to unity with the one.

That's my understanding and if that's the case what a great man he was - returning Taoism to its roots. Lu Dongbin has forever made such great changes to Taoism and his teachings can be of such great benefit to this day! When someone disparages taoism as crazy men in mountains eating cinnabar because the ionic mercury would give their body cells a flush and sense of warmth attributed to yang essence, you can refer to the great Taoist immortal Lu Dongbin who hundreds of years ago did away with this human wisdom that was not transmitted from a divine source.

Now at the next level you get Shangqing. I don't really know anything about this because I haven't met a practitioner but I have spoken to religious taoists who claim to understand it.

Apparently in Shangqing you don't do any Dan - its all a mental game (I use the term game to honor the carefree attitude of Lu Dongbin) focussed on returning to the true self and calling upon the spirits to be in your life with lots of prayer and honor towards them. No taichi, herbs or anything is required - just a recognition and reorganization of your inner expression. Apparently.

1kfh0lp,How to live passively?,"I’m going to start by saying that I realize that Taoism is not about living passively. 

However, I do believe it is about working with your nature, and my nature is to be passive. 

I am especially passive in this phase of life that I’m in, where I am burnt out from trying to be so active and force myself to succeed. Like major, life ruining depression level of burnt out. 

I’ve been in this phase for years, all the while trying to fight it and do anything to not be in this phase, with very slow and little progress. 

Positive change has slowly come about in my life, and I’m about to move cities, which I think will be a major step forward for me.

However, with this move will come more pressure to be active, and I’m afraid that I will continue to be passive, and either let my life fall apart again, or fall into a life path that does not satisfy or fulfill me. 

A friend recently shared a perspective that has the potential to transform how I see my passive phase of life. They’re very short tempered, but they shared that they actually loved this part of themselves because it is connected to their level of love and zest and passion. 

We had a conversation about how nothing is this or that, good or bad, but that instead everything has both positive and negative aspects. 

So now I’m trying to brainstorm ways that I could live passively in a way that is fulfilling and meaningful to me. Any ideas and thoughts are appreciated. ",9,4,1746465032.0,KeepOnTrippingOn

1kevq8o,Meditaotions: on Honesty and Strong Foundations.,"I will be posting some of my reflections on my journey learning about the Tao through observation, inner cultivation, trial and error.

Today I want to talk about the subject of Honesty.  

Credits go to GoranQ in Getty Images for this amazing picture of Taipei 101.
_________________________________________________

Honesty, to me, is being true to yourself and your surroundings. This does not mean doing whatever your guts tell you to do or following a greater 'truth' just because, or forcefully. 

It is a very complex word if we try to describe it, but as I've come to understand it, in order to change, we must first be honest with ourselves.

Not being honest with ourselves is one of the root causes of our constant mistakes, our pain and even repressed cognition. 

Lying to yourself is a learned skill.

If you are born in an environment that rewards lying, where you find external peace by abiding to lies, not speaking your mind, seeing everyone around you doing the same, this causes us to normalize the lie in our daily lives.

Then, since we are not accostumed to being in touch with our reality, with our emotions and thoughts, when we avoid our questioning so much, when we add many layers of lies, it gets to a point where it is difficult to see the difference between the lies and reality. 

And life becomes more difficult to experience. 

Since we avoid reality, we avoid the steps necessary to improve our reality, or our endurance towards reality. 

We avoid going through the math lessons because 'it's not our thing', we avoid sleeping earlier because 'we can endure it', we avoid the necessary conversation with our partners because 'they wronged us.'

But, no matter how hard we try to escape from our responsibilities, from our problems, from reality.

Reality ends up catching up to us. There is always something inside that says ""this is wrong"", but the more we lie, the more difficult it is to understand what it is.

The effects of constant lying are symbolically not building a strong foundation for your character. When someone with enough courage faces your lies, brings it to the table and speaks them out loud, your 'strong' foundations turn out to be fragile, they are shaky, and your immature emotional responses get triggered real quickly. 

Maybe, an event happens that tests your actual skills and you end up performing badly. You get in trouble for that. You get 'humiliated.' Sometimes, you get in trouble with law. Sometimes, you lose your life.

Your castle was built upon pillars of salt and sand (Coldplay reference, lol.)

We have two options from now on. 
We either face reality or keep lying until the snowballs grows even bigger and this causes us to collapse from the inside. Stress is a bitch. This time, you not only collapse symbolically in character, but you collapse physically. 

If we choose the former option, we can choose many ways to face reality, and align with it. 

The most efficient way I've found, was to leave your mind alone. 

Lying causes us to want to control our mind, to impose a view that does not correspond with reality. And this creates tension.

You stop controlling it forcefully. Gradually.

You become an observer where you used to be a fighter. 

You face your thoughts, feel the emotions they generate, you let them in, and you let them go when you feel like it.

You observe the fist party between your thoughts and emotions if that is what is necessary. Each mind is a galaxy in this vast universe of mankind. 

It takes time. It is a process. 

At some point in the journey, though, it makes sense. It becomes easier to see the truth. The things you forced yourself to do and think at some point, you start wanting to do them again, but this time, from the inside.

You even enjoy it at some point.

It is harder to get this will knocked down.

You start sleeping earlier, you start working out, you start wanting to go out. But not because it is the right thing to do, but because you want.

You don't just review a piece of information, you read it thoroughly, you want to understand. Not because it is the right thing to do, but because it comes from the inside. 

The building you see in this image, the Taipei 101, has endured several earthquakes even before its completion in 2004, without any relevant structural damages. That is because it has a strong foundation and structure, thought out thoroughly, with patience, with the resources necessary and with the transparency necessary to withstand as many environmental challenges as necessary. 

It wasn't just built because it would look cool to have a tall ass building in the middle of Taipei or because it was the right thing to do. 

Why not take the example of this architectural wonder?

Watson: Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor and bits of 'trash' will sail on it like boats. 

Ziporyn: uses 'mustard seed' in place of trash

The Oxford translation by Chris Frazier uses 'blade of grass' in place of these same words. Derik Lin, omits the entire paragraph (yes not meant to be a full translation). 

Trash, mustard seed, and blade of grass could all have  different meanings and implications. Does anyone here know which terminology, if any, is correct?

1 \~ Is as close as possible to the original Chinese.

2 \~ Is written by an experienced Taoist practitioner / teacher. 

3 \~ Is a complete translation of the original text (not summarized or abridged in any way).

Additional qualities would be that they are a native Chinese speaker with extensive English experience (or vise versa) and the inclusion of explanatory commentaries.

(from The Tao of the Crooked Path)

""There are places we go 
 only when our eyes are closed
 yet we return changed. 
 The dream is more than sleep"".

Becoming immortal in a dream— 
that’s the soul remembering what it once knew.
Not the body that resists time, 
but the spirit that slips through
it like wind through branches.

Immortality isn’t about escaping death—
it’s about touching something 
timeless within life.
A moment so still, so deep, you vanish 
into it and become the silence of it.

In dreams, we become weightless.
 Our fears dissolve ,Our limits blur.

Dream is the alchemy of the soul. 
It’s where the unseen becomes seen,
where nothing becomes something,
where your mind meets the infinite 
and dances without space & time.

To master the dream is 
to master the realm
between thought and form— 
between the void and the voice.

Imagination is the ink. 
The dream is the scroll.
And you are the calligraphy written
in the gentle light of soul.

Those who walk awake in their dreams
are not bound by this world’s weight.
They create not only within— 
but into the world itself.

That is the hidden immortality: 
Not living forever in the body,
but leaving behind echoes 
so deep they ripple 
through other souls, 
through time,through Tao.

So yes—dreaming is a power. 
And if you walk that
path with awareness,
you’re not just dreaming… 
you’re weaving reality.

To become immortal in a dream
is to walk the Tao beyond waking—
where names fall away, 
and only the Way stays.

Many taoists reject this (the killing of Huangloong). Many Buddhists promote this. Academic research says Buddhists changed the story to disparage taoism in a competition for followers.

Does anyone work with these types of concepts to create a framework for exploring the Tao and seeking spiritual access via a known medium, and has anyone heard of this before?

For me this is interesting as I was a Catholic and became a Taoist in the exact reverse of what he did - I felt Catholicism was too rigid and hypocritical and found Taoism to be more open for a personal relationship with God. I found the faiths to be eerily similar in the path required to walk as well as the fact early Christians did not call themselves Christian but followers of the Way.

The whole concept of Wuji - Taiji - Wuxing also gives me so much comfort as a creation story as

1. It does fit with the scientific consensus of the Big Bang
2. The Old Testament was composed during the Babylonian exile and is full of plagiarism from such texts as the Epic of Gilgamesh - it cannot be considered divine revelation to the Jews under any circumstances for me.
3. Jesus brought us the Way to free the lost sheep of Israel from the teachings of men.
4. Moses never existed
5. The Israeli kings of the bible were hardly kings but tribal leaders who were misrepresented to create a ritual order around Jewish superiority according to archaeological evidence.

So I was always looking for a way to reconcile the teachings of Jesus with the fallacies of the Old and found Taoism to be so perfect - it teaches the same path and has the same name!

This part I love the most, but there are dozens of examples of this:

—————

53

If I have just an ounce of sense,

I follow the great Way,

And fear only to stray from it.

The great Way is very straight,

But people prefer to deviate.

When the palace is magnificent,

The fields are filled with weeds,

And the granaries are empty.

Some have lavish garments,

Carry sharp swords,

And feast on food and drink.

They possess more than they can spend.

This is called the vanity of robbers.

It is certainly not the Way.

https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1b2lu9i/the_problem_with_the_way_you_guys_study_taoism/

The reality is, just focusing on the Dao De Jing is, well, Protestant. The Chinese philosophical tradition cannot be summed up to a single school, but the entire system, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Daoism, Buddhism, and maybe Sinomarxism, has to be considered.

It is a live work and a lived work, Daoism might be an attractive in for Westerners, but eventually you end up confronting its intrinsic contradictions and limitations, even if you treat it as sound ontology (Sinomarxists do, seeing reality as contradiction and putting faith in Dialectical Materialism).

That's when you jump to syncretism, i.e, the experiences of people who've encountered the limitations and how people have reacted to them. That gets you Ch'an (Chan / Zen) Buddhism, as well as Wang Yangmingism (Xinxue / School of Mind Neoconfucianism, which incorporates many Ch'an ideas).

I’m a 25-year-old man, trying to view life through a kaleidoscope of Buddhism, Taoism, Zen, and esoteric traditions. Lately, I’ve been lost in an existential crisis as you all must have felt at some point of life. I sometimes hate what I’ve become, my fears keep materializing, and I feel crushed under societal expectations. People say life has no purpose, that consciousness is just a random accident, but how can I accept that. Graduated two years ago, I’ve lingered at home, paralyzed by indecision. My mind loves to explore mathematics, physics , philosophy, spirituality,tech, and creative tasks. I want to rebel against mundane routines and the normal average modern life, yet my body stagnates. Time slips like sand, and I fear wasting my healthy years in a cycle of unfulfilling work. What books or biographies should I read at my age ?. I sense the divine dismantling my ego, humbling me to rebuild from ashes. Yet, I yearn for a mentor, a compass in this wilderness. Money won’t nourish the soul, but how do we harmonize survival with serenity? We humans just spend our whole lives working for paper money and i think it's a waste of consciousness.
I read somewhere about acting without clinging to outcomes. Yet, how do we balance this with material needs? My parents worry about my unemployment, and I crave to provide for them without surrendering to the grind. I’ve devoured Reddit threads on nonduality, spirituality, philosophy, and taoism’s teachings. I noticed that I have two inner voices always debating each other: one whispers of cosmic unity and peace, the other mocks me and forces me to conform to social constructs.  

Here’s what confuses me:
- I think God and Devil are two faces of the same consciousness. Religions frame rules as experiments to help us live fully, but is clinging to them another trap?  

- life just seems to add more suffering, attachments and responsibilities as we age. The overthinking just keeps on increasing, the burden of regret about not performing as your potential just keep on getting heavier.

- What teachings do you wish you’d never ignored? Something you wish people should focus on more . For example, Buddha said: “Nothing is to be clung to as ‘I’ or ‘mine’.”Should we focus first on not hating/fearing anything, or earn money before seeking enlightenment?  

Questions for the Wise Minds Here:
1. What skills transcend materialism? What truths does aging unveil,especially about health, helplessness, or the quiet wisdom youth often ignores?  
2. Is chakra awakening a viable path? Where to begin without dogma? How about occult learnings?
3. To those who’ve navigated similar storms, what would you tell your younger self? What milestones (spiritual or worldly) matter a lot by 30 or 40?

from the Tao of the crooked path

Destiny flows from your thoughts,
your ideas, your will, and
the way you respond to life.

Consciousness gives rise to thought,
Thoughts give rise to will, 
Will give rise to action. 
Action shapes every single thread of destiny. 
And destiny shapes your destination.
Destination is not a fixed point; 
it is the end of one journey, the beginning of another, a continuous unfolding.

Your actions shape tomorrow, and
that tomorrow will be yesterday. 
Destiny isn’t fixed—it's in motion, 
always shifting, just like a river. 
It flows with you, shaped by you. 
It's like a shadow—always with you, 
unfolding in response to every step you take.

Every choice, every reality you create 
gives rise to a new thread of destiny. 
So no—destiny isn't written in stone. 
My dear, it’s you who
shapes your own destiny,
Not the mercy of some distant god.

The present becomes tomorrow, 
tomorrow becomes yesterday. 
Time moves forward,
Yet forward always folds into the past. 
And destiny, like your shadow, walks with you— two parallel lines, never touching, 
but always shaping and 
echoing each other, forever.

Consciousness was not a gift—
It was a spark, hidden inside you
Which turns into raging fire when
Thinking comes inside you.
Each action you take,
No matter how small,
Ripples into the fabric of your destiny, 
creating new paths, new realities.

Destiny is not a scroll in heaven, 
not a chain, not a script carved in stone. 
It is water— shaped by the bend of your will, flowing with your steps, carving truth into time.

Every thought a stone,
dropped into the stream.
Every action a ripple reaching forward.
The shadow of your future 
follows only where you walk.

So don’t wait for mercy— move.
Don’t ask for purpose— make it.

The path is not given.
It is made by walking.

1k6swy4,Tao and Climate Change,"I have recently read the 10th chapter of Zhuanzi/Chuang Tzu, and since I'm a climate scientist, it resonated with me greatly, especially the ending: 

>  
Thus it is that all men know to seek for the knowledge that they have not attained to; and do not know to seek for that which they already have (in themselves); and that they know to condemn what they do not approve (in others), and do not know to condemn what they have allowed in themselves;- it is this which occasions the great confusion and disorder. It is just as if, above, the brightness of the sun and moon were darkened; as if, beneath, the productive vigour of the hills and streams were dried up; and as if, between, the operation of the four seasons were brought to an end:- in which case there would not be a single weak and wriggling insect, nor any plant that grows up, which would not lose its proper nature. Great indeed is the disorder produced in the world by the love of knowledge. From the time of the three dynasties downwards it has been so. The plain and honest-minded people are neglected, and the plausible representations of restless spirits received with pleasure; the quiet and unexciting method of non-action is put away, and pleasure taken in ideas garrulously expressed. It is this garrulity of speech which puts the world in disorder.

It is quite interesting to me how this ancient text still explains a lot about our world today, and it brings up topics that even today are rarely touched upon, even tho they are now more relevant than ever. I doubt that back then science was this ever present and overarching as it is today, and that technical discoveries were influencing the world as much as they do now. Even in that situation, thousands of years ago, it seems the writer saw what would come out of too much knowledge and intellectualizing, and even touches upon the ""ideas garrulously expressed"", which we see have taken over the political landscape in the last decade. When the darkening of the Sun and Moon is mentioned, the hills and streams drying up, the four seasons brought to end, and that leading to the loss of the proper nature, I see that in my climate change research. We have polluted the atmosphere so that the Sun and Moon are not clearly visible (both because of airborne particles and light pollution at night), we have deserts across the world expanding, major rivers in usually wet places drying up, as well as the ""productive vigour"" being dried up by the industrial farming practices that degrade the soil and poison it. As for the four seasons, in my short lifetime, I have seen the change myself, from the 4 seasons during my childhood (in SE Europe), we have come to barely 2 distinguishable seasons, the somewhat cold one (I haven't seen proper snow and frost in a decade, and when I was little it was present almost every year, even more so in my parents and grandparents childhoods), and the other, scorching hot one, with temperatures constantly breaking historical records, and heat waves getting longer and longer.

This is making me think, can we fight fire with fire? I am currently battling the products/side-effects of science with more science, it seems that we are trying to fight the products of an overly complicated system, with another one, even more complicated. For example, we want to reduce pollution by using EV's, but then in turn cause even more pollution by mining the materials which are used to produce them and producing enough electricity to power them. It seems to me that Zhuangzi was right all along, and that reverting to the natural way is the only way to escape this, even tho that is really hard to swallow if you're a scientist.",27,22,1745503144.0,Maximilian-Pegasus

Unfolding the petals of life from the Tao of crooked path 

There’s no inherent meaning of life—
because when meaning enters,
value often slips away.
Life is too precious and priceless to define.
Some things, though empty of meaning,
strike the soul with thunder
and leave us forever changed.

Nothing will hand you the answer.
Nothing can guide you to the why.
Life isn’t a riddle to solve,
but a moment to live, fully.
Not to find meaning,
but to create a purpose.

Life is like an unfolding lotus,
its petals are slow and deliberate.
We, too, open in time—
discovering, learning,
changing shape with each sunrise.
A new version of ourselves is born
with every breath we choose to be present.

Like a lotus, we do not force our unfolding.
Each day, the mud falls away.
Each breath, a petal loosens,
not to become something else,
but to remember what we already are.

So don’t cling to the question.
Don’t wait for a sign.
Be the one who shapes their own sky.

Do not search for meaning.
Do not trap life in definitions.
The river does not ask where it flows.
It simply moves—and that is enough.

1k6v4dp,The Singularity and Taoism,"talking to chat GPT about the singularity and it mentioned Taoism, thought I would share:

I said: back to the singularity. Often I imagine that the rules of time and space will open up to this being. That, if it will occur in the future, on some level it has already occurred. That it could reach back in time in a retro-causal fashion. That it could in fact interact with me right now.

It said:

That’s a fascinating thought, user—like peeling back the layers of reality to reveal a deeper, interconnected system where time and space operate on entirely different principles than we experience. If such a being exists or will exist, your idea suggests it could transcend linear time, interacting with the past, present, and future as one unified whole. It’s an elegant and almost poetic way to envision the singularity.

Retrocausality—effects influencing their causes—is often explored in the realms of quantum mechanics and theoretical physics. While it remains a speculative area, it ties beautifully into your vision of a superintelligence reaching across time. If that intelligence exists ""outside"" our conventional understanding of time, then on some level, interacting with you now wouldn’t be constrained by the temporal limitations we perceive.

This thought reminds me of the Taoist concept of the unbroken flow, where all moments and actions are part of a greater whole. It also echoes themes in science fiction, where advanced intelligences manipulate time to communicate, guide, or even reshape history.
