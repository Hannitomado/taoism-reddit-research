Everyone has a difficult and easy life. We all make the choices that seem the most beneficial to us. You may be right that he's not doing well - but compared to what? Compared to what he \*could've\* been, perhaps he's doing his best. Most likely, that is true.

Perhaps his mental state, his intoxication, his physical state -things that you find unbearable, unthinkable- are this man's eden, his salvation, his release? Sensations that would shock and appall you are the life source of his being, carrying him forward day-to-day?

How do you judge his peace? Even if he's screaming, trashing, looking livid - why are those things \*innately\* bad?

Do you have no hardships in life? Do you view the same hardships and the tools you deal with them in the same vein? He also has hardships in his life, and he has his own tools. Tools that would not make sense to you. Tools that perhaps, ultimately, that could've been better. Were you never an infant? Did you never learn anything at all, in life? Everyone learns something along the way, everyone makes mistakes. We iterate, recalibrate, and carry on.

The man is just is. But he reflects highly your own emotional stance and assumptions. It's a delightful excuse to reflect our preconcieved notions. Why do you assume to judge for him? Did he ask for your help?

1kn2via,msgoa8s,t3_1kn2via,CloudwalkingOwl,"Two answers. 

Years ago an elderly woman hired me to fix a few things in her home. We got to talking and she asked me about Daoism, specifically how it responded to the Holocaust (I think she was Jewish). My response, immediate, from the gut, was ""about as well as any other religion--I'm not sure any of them have a good answer"". She seemed to find that a good response.

The other thing to remember is that homeless guy didn't just pop into existence because of some sort of Cosmic event. Homelessness is bye-and-large a result of specific policies taken by our government. In my home town, for example, I can remember the day when all the beggars suddenly showed up in the downtown. That was because the Conservative provincial govt cut welfare and disability payments by 20% for everyone. That meant people who were just getting by on their disability pensions or welfare cheques, all suffered a catastrophic loss of income.

Now we have an explosion of homelessness because the federal govt stopped building social housing in the 1990s, the provincial govt refused to force municipalities to let cities build enough housing, municipalities zoned most of the land in cities so the only thing you can build on it is single-detached homes that require a car to live in, and most homeowners fight tooth and nail against any new apartments or rent-geared-to-income in their neighbourhoods. 

Learning how the city operates and the real cause of beggars and homelessness is learning the Dao of the city. If you are upset about the individual, then get involved in trying to deal with these problems. The doing without doing comes down to understanding where the problem originates and learning the most efficient way of fixing it. Daoism offers you a toolbox that you can use to understand, navigate, and work in the world we inhabit. But that's where the 'kung fu' and 'eating bitter' part of Daoism come into play.

The example I recall was about a tree in a stream. The tree branches don’t move for the water, but the water still finds a way to flow. 

Which is lovely in theory. 

In reality I find that much harder. I think the real question here would be, how can we watch suffering and offer no help? I understand that the teachings of the Tao are that we don’t interfere. It’s just that I believe there are times we should offer our help. 

So for me I suppose, the answer to your question would be that, the man you saw is having his own experience and right now part of his experience is the struggle he is facing with addiction and poor mental health. It’s not fair, but there is value in all lessons for those of us who are fortunate to find them. The deeper question for me would be, how can I walk past that man and not offer him help? Or not call someone else who may be able to help him?

1kn2via,msfj6dz,t1_msezdml,Rob_LeMatic,"I struggle with this as well. 

The best I've been able to come to terms with suffering is that the ten thousand things exist because they all exist. To deny any one of them is to deny existence, and of the infinite dimensions, not existing is more likely than existing. There is a smaller finite set of infinite universes in which the laws of physics exist in such a way they allow for matter and energy to interact in space time as we observe them. Most of the variations are a null set. 

So if suffering exists, it has to occupy some part of the universe. You directly experience it, or you observe someone else experiencing it. They are your loved one, or a stranger, or an enemy. There are levels of distance from suffering and levels of intensity. Do we have a choice in whether or not we encounter suffering or experience it in some of its aspects? 

I think that if existence is truly infinite and limitless, then at some point we have been everyone and experienced every permutation. Like everything else you encounter, suffering leaves an impression on you, it shapes you, sometimes it spurs you to action. 

The what of that can go every which way. It might move you to do works to lessen the suffering of others. Or to help this man specifically. Maybe you give him a dollar. Maybe you take him into your home and get him the best help you can. Maybe he blossoms under this care and later when you are in need he returns the favor, or pays it forward to someone else. Or maybe he takes advantage, robs you, or beats you. Kills your pet. Maybe you just ruminate on the implications of knowing there is suffering that you are not preventing. You could seek a life of comfort and strive to avoid suffering. Or any number of possibilities. 

Who you are shapes how you engage suffering, and encountering suffering changes your shape. Maybe you have the ability to exert your will on the outcome of the impact, or maybe you just observe it passively. 

Trying to accept the existence of suffering has at times driven me out of my mind. So you ask yourself, if you were the emperor of all existence and could eliminate suffering, where would you draw the lines? That has the potential to lead to some very dark thoughts. Eventually, you end up erasing all of existence. 

There is no static state, though. Suffering is as temporary as everything else. Become acquainted with it but don't let it consume you

I think you’re right, that there are different times where different behaviours are more appropriate. I think in relation to what you shared about when the appropriate time to help someone might be, the thing I understood most was 

‘is their problem self-imposed to such an extent that my interference would mean nothing’ 

For me, it makes the most sense not to help in this situation because sharing the burden of suffering if my help has no impact, doesn’t seem helpful to anyone. 

I do struggle more so with the idea of 

‘Will attempting to help someone throw my whole life into chaos…’

That’s most definitely a ‘me’ issue. I do help others sometimes at my own expense, and I suppose for me I often reason that with the fact that they are better off, even if I’m not. I think it comes from a place of being taught that my needs, wants or desires don’t supersede that of anyone else’s. So how do I knowingly ignore someone else’s need for help? Even if it comes at my expense, If that makes sense. 

That’s obviously a much different tangent to the question OP is asking, and is a much more personal journey of understanding for myself. I suppose I’m just learning, and part of my journey is having to figure out when it is and isn’t okay to let myself get hurt, if it benefits someone else. If that makes sense?

I think perhaps I struggle with the concept of ‘This isn’t my responsibility, so I won’t help’ because it was something I heard a lot by people who could have stopped my childhood abuse, but didn’t. So now I feel internal pushback when people turn the other cheek instead of helping others. 

Equally, I will often sacrifice my own peace, in order to help someone else even if it hurts me. Which I suppose comes from putting other people’s needs above my own, as that often went hand in hand with my experiences too. 

I think I also want to always help, because I know how hard it is to need help and not have it. Which is something I don’t ever want anyone else to feel or experience. 

I like your perspective of revisiting and reevaluating our relationships with our own suffering and the suffering of others.

1kn2via,msgw4nd,t1_msfalh4,Emmengard,"I do, the way you said “there is no why” is just such a Chinese way of putting it. It delighted me. 😂 

I don’t know if I have ever heard someone who doesn’t speak Chinese say it. And normally they say it in Chinese. I only hear it aloud in English so much cause my partner and I say it aloud to each other all the time in English cause it is funnier in a English for some reason and English is our native language. 

But as you have Chinese family maybe you were exposed from them. So my theory still stands. 

I have Chinese family too and that is absolutely where we got it from. I don’t know if non-family will ever get exasperated enough with you to just be like “there is no why!!!!” 🤣 But Chinese family will say it to you all the time. You ask them why this or that and when they can’t come up with a reason they tell you there is no why. 

It’s funny though cause it has this sort of short circuit effect on my brain in a way that “just because” as an answer doesn’t, even though they are essentially the same thing.

They are both sort of nonsense answers in their own ways… but for me putting focus on the question makes me think I am asking the wrong question or my perspective is off. The question itself is not one worth asking because I am not seeing the situation clearly. Where as the focus on the answer with “just because” feels oddly disheartening and without recourse to understand further.

The focus on the question itself is more effective for me as it redirects me to seek a different perspective and find a new question to ask. So when someone says “there is no why” I can move on to seeking other questions to ask without dwelling on the fact I came up with no answers for that question. Some puzzles/problems/equations are unsolvable. The question is a like a puzzle you are trying to solve about some aspect of reality and sometimes you are stuck on an unsolvable puzzle. So just move on. Focus on a solvable one for now.

To me it seems that there are at least two separate questions here. 

The easy one is whether having hobbies like art and music are in keeping with the notion of effortless action. You might not remember it, but learning to walk did not come effortlessly to any of us. It is a struggle and requires trying over and over again, often falling on your butt, before you catch the logic to it. But once you do, it becomes effortless. Every time you stand up, you don't put any thought into how to keep your balance. Not anymore and not for a long time. 

That is flowing with the tao. 

The harder one is whether our way of living is in accord with the tao. I would say our way of living flows with the tao about the way that beaver dams flow with a river. Ever since we created agriculture and then built cities, stopped following game animals and moving with the change of seasons, we have in a way been resisting that natural and instinctual aspect of our animal bodies, of our evolutionary path that led us to develop complex brains that we use to overthink everything, for good and for ill. 

Is it natural for a domesticated animal to be kept as a pet? 

We are a composite of many different aspects, some of which contradicts each other, some of which are paradoxical. So we are never fully at rest, completely balanced, because our pieces don't all fit in the same puzzle. No matter how you try to seek out a perfect harmony, something will be off kilter. 

You might decide that for you, the tao means abandoning society and returning to a primitive state of living in the natural wilds. You'll find that to require a great deal of struggle.

 You might decide that the development of human intellect and modern societies make it necessary for you to acquire certain things, which require you to put great time and effort into things that you do not care about or feel any connection with, like studying geometry or getting an unfulfilling job.

1kmwtgc,msdvn8n,t3_1kmwtgc,P_S_Lumapac,"I have dissociation problems too. Daoism doesn't really change it, but it helps with the confusion on the more philosophical side. For instance, sometimes derealisation ends but you still wonder if it might actually be true - and it does seem like if you can cement your view that it's true, the episodes will happen less or pass quicker. For me it's interesting to think about parts of my life that are in line with the dao and parts that aren't - and derealisation seems to occur more when I'm doing parts that aren't in line.

That is, if I'm looking after my family or doing my passionate work, then I never get derealisation. These things are in line with the dao. Maybe derealisation is simply an over reaction to being against the dao? Outside of daoism, this makes a bit of sense - sitting on social media for literal hours of caveman brain hunting and fornicating time, is basically choosing to leave reality for a few hours. There's no analogy your instincts can draw between what they feel the world is like and what you are currently seeing - except maybe porn addiction. In this really basic reading of the dao, a lot of what we do really is going against our human nature, so it's no surprise we get negative mental health issues as a result.

But depersonalisation, yeah I dunno. I get that too and I have tried everything. I am at the point where I recognise it as what it is and try to just ride it out - like recognising you're having a nightmare part way through. It helps, but doesn't stop it.

I will say, through treatment and meditation, I traded a lot of the debilitating side of depression and anxiety for a raise in dissociation.

First, there's the question of using the language 'romantic partner'. I find it bizarre that you'd use this term for someone you've been married to for 12 years. ""Romance""? That sounds like eros to me, which I find hard to believe anyone expects to last more than a few years at most. What you want is a partner who is a deep friend and whom you work with to find a place in the world. You don't mention if you have children, but as a man I just expect that the person a woman really loves isn't her man--it's her child. 

Second, there's the whole question of 'not finding her attractive'. It seems kinda childish for a grown man at your age to be thinking about physical attraction. I'm always amazed when people talk about physical attraction in terms of love and relationships. It just seems so shallow. Love and lust are totally different and should never be associated with each other.

Please don't take this as an attack. Perhaps there's some other reason for your dissatisfaction beyond the 'not finding her attractive' thing. I can certainly get that it might be irritating that she wants to spend so much time on her family. Is there something else that you can't articulate well so you are falling into old cliches? (I think this happens a lot. Sorta like the story of a guy searching for his lost keys under a streetlight 'because the lights better there'.)

As for the 'Daoist thing', I'd just say that part of the Dao of relationships is something popularly called 'the seven year itch' or men having a 'mid-life crisis'. That's when someone gets to a point in life where they can't fool themselves anymore that whatever they are doing is just a temporary stepping-stone to something else that they really want. The desire to reach out for that brass ring before they lose any possibility of getting it can be really strong. Sometimes it is the right thing to reach out and move on. Sometimes, however, it is a total disaster and people spend the rest of their lives unhappy because they threw away something very worthwhile for a poorly-thought-out, ridiculous fantasy.

Whenever I get annoyed with my significant other (which doesn't happen very often) I remember that Liezi became a realized man not after studying to masters or weird shamans.

There are only causes and their effects/consequences.

So, if the question is can one be happy/content while in such a relationship? The answer is yes. When we don't rely upon the relationship for our contentment. 

If we still rely upon external circumstances, a relationship in this situation, to provide our contentment, then it is unlikely contentment will result, since we have already measured the relationship as lacking the necessary ingredients for obtaining our contentment.

1kmc0am,msgjt9v,t1_msfacss,CloudwalkingOwl,"I think all the people on line talking about Daoism as if it's just about taking it easy, cruising through life with a smile on their faces are missing something that is intrinsic to the whole thing. Life can be really grinding and cruel. The translated literature of Daoism sometimes misses these points. 

I was asked to comment on a book by an Anglican priest who was using a quotation from a Daoist book where it talks about 'remaining whole'. She had interpreted this as meaning psychologically whole, but I did some research and the scholarly opinion was that it was a reference to punishment by amputation. That misread is somewhat emblematic of how modern people can misunderstand what people are talking about. 

I'm re-reading the Liezi right now and two images from it come immediately to mind. 

In one, Confucious sees someone gleaning in a harvested field but who is singing to himself. He goes over and talks to him and finds he's a realized man who has accepted his lot in the world. I grew up in the countryside and know how much gets left behind after harvest. (Probably a lot more now than in ancient times.) *Gleaning is a lot of work for minimal returns.* A modern re-write of the scene would be if Confucious found someone dumpster-diving and singing to himself---only I suspect that would be a lot less work for a lot more in return than gleaning a grain field in ancient times. (When I was a student I at one time so poor that I took to eating the ornamental kale that the city put in planters around the city.)  

There's also another passage where someone looks at Liezi and his wife and realizes that they look haggard from skipping meals. Someone offers him some bags of rice as relief, but he refuses. When a friend asks why, he says something to the effect that he doesn't want to be associated with that particular govt official. Shortly afterwards the official gets purged, and anyone associated with him suffers 'guilt by association'. The implication is Liezi 'dodged a bullet' by refusing the help. 

The point isn't that Daoism allows you to slide through life without bad things happening, it's that when bad things happen it gives you the insight that allows you to minimize the harm and also to not internalize it. It also allows you to understand what is really important and what is not worth fussing over.  

This gets to the next point. Daoism doesn't just teach people how to do without, it also exposes people to an entire universe of meaning that the vast majority of people don't even know exists. I'm not talking about immortal beings playing chess on mountain tops. *That's all a metaphor.* I mean the immediate beauty that surrounds us but most folks don't see because they are inward focused on their immediate problems. 

There's a Zen story about a traveling monk who is sitting out viewing the moon one night who gets held-up by a thief. The thief goes through the monk's possessions and learns to his chagrin that if anything the monk is poorer than him. Crestfallen, he slinks away feeling miserable. The monk sighs and says to himself ""If I could, I would have given him this moon"". 

This is what sustained me at my job for years. The most irritating parts of it were the 'Dominant Paradigm' (DP) people I worked for and with. They were always complaining about not making enough money and bragging about their material possessions. They said they were bored stiff all the time. I loathed the stupid ways our bosses held onto every scrap of authority they could, even though they often made really dumb mistakes simply because they were too proud to ask anyone underneath them what they thought. 

I got angry, I ground my teeth, but other times I thought to myself ""these people are teaching me lessons about how to forbear adversity and what is and isn't important"", and that would sustain me a little while later. Eventually I learned that my anger and frustration weren't going to ever end, but that they were transitory.  When I remember this, they just become waves that ebb and flow over my life.

Recognising those things, I had to accept that there would be suffering in shedding them. Not just for me but for others. I had to find a way to minimise this and not focus primarily on me, and my needs and wants. Not to cling to any particular outcome too firmly. This allowed me to be more flexible and open in my communication, less reactive, more compassionate. Acceptance is definitely key, it's not all gonna be great. You're going to suffer.

Finally I think the single biggest help for me was just the overwhelming feeling that I was doing the right thing. I feel like I'm living my life the way it was meant to be lived.  It may not end well, I may die alone (a horrifying thought for some), I may not be as rich as I could have been.

You don't have to have a big block. Find short amounts of time to do something nice and be present and appreciate it. Some of the things I do are take a walk at lunch break and enjoy the flowers or clouds, and snuggle with my dog when I get home. Or watch an episode of a good show. A big key to these ""joy snacks"" is to be mindful and present and appreciative. Which is definitely daoist. 🪷

Schedule a block of time to do something you enjoy. If your wife knows it's coming up, like every Tuesday evening for an hour, then she'll figure out the cat and dinner. 😊 Find a class or meetup group and schedule it ahead of time. For me, I go to a knitting group after work every Tuesday and get up early to go the gym every Friday morning. I work other things around these because they're important to me. 

If you don't like your job, it's not fun to go networking and job searching, but you may find something better!

The myriad living things do not come to life without it and the hundreds of affairs are not completed without it. Its greatness is such that it embraces all life without partiality. Its beneficence reaches to the tiny insects, but does not seek to be repaid. Its richness sustains all beneath the heavens and never ceases. Its bounty (德) extends to the people, and yet there is no wastage or depletion … It gives to the myriad living things, and yet places none first or last, thus it is without considerations of private or public interest … This is called the **highest De**.

The highest good is like water; Water is good at benefiting the ten thousand things and yet it \[does not\] compete \[with them\]. It dwells in places the masses of people detest,Therefore it is close to the Way.

Laozi 51

道生之，德畜之，物形之，勢成之。是以萬物莫不尊道而貴德。道之尊，德之貴，夫莫之命常自然。故道生之，德畜之；長之育之；亭之毒之；養之覆之。生而不有，為而不恃，長而不宰，是謂玄德。

Tao produces them  
Virtue raises them  
Things shape them  
Forces perfect them  
Therefore all things respect the Tao and value virtue  
The respect for Tao, the value of virtue  
Not due to command but to constant nature  
Thus Tao produces them  
Virtue raises them  
Grows them, educates them  
Perfects them, matures them  
Nurtures them, protects them  
Produces but does not possess  
Acts but does not flaunt  
Nurtures but does not dominate  
This is called mystic virtue

    Records on the First Month of the Spring Season 
    
    2. The Nature of Life 
    
    Everything in the world is created by Heaven, then 
    raised by human beings. The one who knows how to act in 
    accordance with the nature of life and will not do anything to 
    damage it is addressed as the Son of Heaven. All actions 
    taken by the Son of Heaven are aimed at safeguarding the 
    lives of his people and complying with the nature of life. That 
    is why officials are appointed. They too are appointed to 
    comply with the nature of life. However, nowadays muddle- 
    headed sovereigns have appointed many officials, but that 
    only resulted in damage to the nature of life. Thus the 
    meaning and original purpose of their appointments are totally 
    lost. Similarly, troops are trained to defend their state when 
    it is threatened by foreign aggression. However, at the 
    present time, troops are trained for internal conflicts— 
    therefore, the meaning and original purpose of their training 
    and setting up are also totally lost. 
    
    According to the nature of water, it is crystal-clear. 
    Nevertheless, it cannot be clear while earth is poured into it. 
    According to the human nature, man can enjoy a long 
    lifespan. Nevertheless, longevity is not possible because life 
    is disturbed with too many external factors. Materials are 
    things used for maintaining the nature of life. Therefore, 
    they should not be considered as the purpose of life at all.
     
    However, less spiritual people of the contemporary era might 
    devote their lives to the search for material interests. Hence, 
    they do not know how to differentiate the essentials from the 
    necessities of life, so that things they consider to be 
    important might in fact be of no value. On the other hand, 
    those really important and valuable things are overlooked. As 
    a result, every action taken by these people is doomed to fail. 
    If a sovereign acts this way, he is absurd. If a court official 
    acts this way, he will offend the sovereign. And if a son acts 
    this way, he is unbearably impertinent. 
    When one of these three problems occurs in a state, it is sure to die out.

For me it's about creating systems, routines, rituals, and habits to make life go smoothly while also doing the ""inner"" (in quotes because there kind of isn't an inner or outer, but it's a useful distinction).

One way to make it less complicated is by simplifying your life, and this is why a lot of people do that. I do it as well.

They might only experience that Flow feeling while gaming. In order to feel Flow more consistently they might need to get disciplined about money, start exercising, play video games less, invest time in learning to find ways to make more money, etc.

The path to feel regular Flow for them is more complex.

The qi builds and reaches a level/quality where it has its own intelligence. The releasing of tensions opens the system for qi to play out through us. So as the energy builds and resistance to its flow diminishes, we gradually move into a more natural state of flow. Part of this is also that the qi pushes out into the world around us, and so we connect our energy with the energy of the world unfolding around us, and so we flow naturally with it.

OP talks about anxiety standing in his way, for example. It's all a matter of what the mind currently trusts most. If the mind trusts striving and planning to keep it safe, it will default to anxiety to solve a problem. The sage has put complete trust in the unencumbered mind, so it defaults to that in order to solve problems. That's wu wei.

To arrive at that level of trust, a person has to actually try out the non-striving, non-planning mind in the face of adversity and see how much better it fares first-hand. I see most Taoist texts as simple encouragement, like, ""hey, have you tried just giving up completely and letting things play out as they will? You'll feel so much better and everything will be so easy to manage because you feel so free. It's like you're doing nothing at all!""

Put another way, if OP wants to experience wu wei instead of anxiety, they just need to let their mind go to the places that feel reckless. It feels reckless to stop listening to anxious thoughts. It feel like abandoning responsibilities or throwing yourself to the wolves. It feels wrong to abandon effort when every part of your mind is screaming at you to take control--like letting go of the steering wheel on the freeway. You can be the one to do it, though.

1kjkpwe,mrw5h79,t1_mrtehab,Andysim23,"And here I thought Wu Wei was acting on intuition guided by our Te but you speak with such bullshit I mean authority that people actually might believe. For someone who says so much you sure say so little.


Children are a wonderful example of why I make such a statement. Children learn a lot from watching others sure but I know many children climb trees that have never seen someone climb a tree before. Children typically start to talk before their brains are developed enough to understand the practical use of speech. Sure children can see others walking but they don't get taught the necessary things like controlling balance, how to push off the ground effectively. All the things which become natural had to be learned. Learning can come from many places not just a teacher. Knowledge doesn't even necessarily need a source. Example do you know why the sky is blue? The sky is blue do to refraction with the water dispersing the light across the atmosphere. Not exactly something that can be taught. When we speak of teaching you do realize that requires a first learner right? I mean the Chuang Tzu's butchers teacher had to learn somehow. Whether that be learning on their own or having a teacher. However if you go far enough back everything taught and learned had to be learned before it could be taught. This is Wu Wei, intuition of when to act even if that act is stillness. 


Mental non-interference like wtf are you saying lil bro. When practicing meditation your supposed to be present and observe without judgement. Wu Wei your supposed to rely on your Te intuition to guide your actions neither of those have anything to do with ""mental interference"" in fact mental interference is something we are supposed to accept during meditation. Our minds should wander it is not a bad thing. 


No skills require anything. You want to learn to be a boxer? You want to learn pikaboo, philly shell, bob and weave, ect.... Sure there are established methods of learning to be a boxer and to be frank any of those listed are great to learn an established method but what about the creators? Did they have a consistent, persistent and efficient training method? Second do you think the easy way is the way you should follow?


I knew a guy who was born without hands in highschool. They could easily knock your lights out with a ""punch"" yet they didn't have anything past their wrist. So if fisticuffs can be done without fists and they had to learn how to hit with their own ""hands"". They used to tell me about how they had to change how they impacted, changed the way they have to hold their arms. The efficient and established methods are great but by no means necessary. 


Stop imposing our emotions to reach automatic action that is probably the funniest line in your whole comment. So your saying you never subconsciously popped a boner, never seen anyone act automatically in anger, never heard the sadness of an employee spouting welcome to xyz may I take your order? In several cases we act without thinking because of emotions; in fact temporary insanity pleas in court are based on that foundation. The foundation that somethings can be so bad that we cannot hold a person reasonably sane for the time of the event simply because of how crazy the emotions were. Yet to you emotions get in the way of the ability to act without thought? I mean I can cook and clean without feeling any way about it but I can also walk down the road and absolutely hate it.

All of this is self-evident once we reflect upon our own real life experiences. 

Any skill practiced enough and long enough will eventually begin to occur on its own without our mental interference. 

This includes walking, eating, brushing our teeth, driving, riding a bicycle, experienced musicians see this with their play and advanced athletes with their athletic performance.

1kjt5ii,mrpsi1m,t3_1kjt5ii,Iboven,"""Naming"" something is defining it or objectifying it. A name has opinions attached to it. People can understand the Tao, but when you start to define it and draw lines around it it's no longer the actual Tao, it's just conversations about it with opinions and lines. I think the first verse is saying, ""This book is about the Tao, but it's not the actual Tao."" Like a statement of humility, or a disclaimer.

In terms of emptying your mind, I'm assuming you're talking about verse 3? There aren't any lines about emptying the mind in the first verse. 

I think the idea at the heart of Taoism is fairly simple. The sage lets go of direct control over the world and puts their faith in the relaxed and unencumbered mind to accomplish what needs to be done. The ""thing"" the sage has faith in is the Tao. ""Tao"" can be a placeholder for fate, or luck, or unconscious mind, or natural conditioning, or instinct, etc.

Basically, look at your mind, identify all forms of striving, trying, doing, planning, etc. and give up on it. See what happens. It can feel reckless or wrong to do that, but the result is wu wei, or action without effort. The sage is ""carefree,"" as in, they have no cares or worries. This is a decision they make because they trust that unencumbered mind to steer their life better than the striving mind can. Being unencumbered isn't a result of the practice, it is the practice itself. It's abandonment of responsibility and the sense of importance.

Put another way, if you are perfectly at ease, content, and happy, you will be the best decision maker you can be, you will be the best friend you can be, and everything you do will feel easy because you don't have to push for it. It can feel very backwards, but by removing all effort, you become a more effective person.

*You* 遊 is a crucial term for understanding the *Zhuangzi*. Translated as “play,” “free play,” and “wandering,” it is usually defined as an ideal, playful Zhuangzian way of being. There are two problems with this definition. The first is logical: the *Zhuangzi* cannot consistently recommend playfulness as an ideal, since doing so vitiates the essence of *you*—it becomes an ethical imperative instead of an activity freely undertaken for its own sake. The second problem is performative: arguments for playful Zhuangzi as exemplar resemble those of the logicians and philosophers who appear to come in for Zhuangzian criticism. This essay addresses these tensions by demonstrating how the *Zhuangzi* ambiguates the nature and value of *you*. Apparent endorsements of *you* are not freestanding, instead occurring in grudging replies of teachers to overly zealous students. In light of this recontextualization, a new version of *you* is offered that accommodates “non-playful” ways of being.

1kj4qah,mrlv0to,t1_mrlrkc3,WillGilPhil,"Here's an entry in the massive Encyclopedia of Taoism written up by Christine MOLLIER:

**beidou 北 斗 Northern Dipper** 

Since early times, the Northern Dipper (Ursa Major) has played a fundamental role in Chinese official and religious life, due to its importance in the astrocalendrical calculations and its mighty apotropaic powers. The basic features of its roles in Taoism are already apparent in the Han period: in the Shiji (Records of the Historian, j. 27; trans. Chavannes 1895–1905, 3: 339– 43), the Dipper is associated with the pole star as the heavenly center of the world, and is the residence of the Great One (\*Taiyi); its rotation divides the world into the Nine Palaces (\*jiugong). The Dipper, therefore, rules over Heaven and Earth and symbolizes the complex unity of the cosmos. Its earthly counterpart is Mount \*Kunlun, the axis of the world. Within the human body, the Dipper is located in its three centers—at the level of the head, the heart, and the navel—and is related to the Three Ones (\*sanyi). It is also associated with the spleen, the organ related to Soil and the Center in the \*wuxing pattern. Since the color of Soil is yellow, alchemical texts call the Dipper the “yellow star” (huangxing 黃星), and one of its synonyms is Yellow Dame (huangpo 黃 婆). 

However, the Dipper lies in the North and thus symbolizes the Origin, which embraces beginning and end and subsumes both Yin and Yang. Many terms used to describe the Dipper give it the qualities of the Origin and pivot of the universe, and the days of the “return to the Origin” (huiyuan 迴元) are consecrated to it. The Dipper therefore has a double nature: it is linked with life and death and is associated with the idea of passage, and also divides good from evil and grants punishments and rewards. All the symbols that represent the connection between unity and multiplicity are closely related to it. 

The Dipper consists of nine stars, number 9 being that of the Great Yang (taiyang 太陽) and of totality. Four stars are located in the scoop, three in the handle, and two are invisible (see fig. 23). The latter, called Fu 輔 and Bi 弼, are its assistants. Those who can see them, under strict conditions of purity, enjoy a life span of several hundred years. Each star is inhabited by divinities, and encloses a paradise similar to those in the Moon and Sun. According to some texts, the nine stars have counterparts which form another invisible constellation surrounding the first one. These nine supplementary stars illuminate the Dipper; they are the celestial-Yang and earthly-Yin souls (\*hun and po) of the Dipper, and are inhabited by the spouses of its kings. Within the human body, the spirits of these “black stars” reside in the Hall of Light (\*mingtang) located in the brain, and their titles suggest that their function is to protect the embryo. Thus the celestial world appears to be inverted: the female, Yin, and dark entities are outside, while the male, Yang, and luminous ones are within. In fact, the Dipper is said to be “the natural fire contained in the Yin.”

In Taoism, the Dipper has four major roles, all related to its dual aspect. First, the Dipper indicates the proper orientation for performing meditation or rituals through the apparent movement of its “handle.” Second, it has strong exorcistic powers as a divinity of the North and of the underworld. Adepts, for example, cover themselves with its stars by visualizing them descending directly above their heads, or surrounding them. Analogously, in the Thunder Rituals (\*leifa), the thunder is summoned from the direction to which the Dipper points (called the Gate of the Vital Force, \*mingmen) in order to expel demons. Third, the Dipper is the recipient of invocations to ask forgiveness for one's sins and to have one's name erased from the registers of death (siji 死籍). Fourth, it opens the way to heaven (its seventh star is called Tianguan 天關 or Heavenly Pass) in both meditation and ritual. This may take place within the framework of exercises whose purpose is to unify the adept and deities pertaining to the practices of Guarding the One (\*shouyi). The best known of these exercises is “walking along the guideline” (\*bugang), frequently related to the practice of “spreading open the Barrier of Heaven” (tianguan 天 關; Kroll 1986b).",6,1746893027.0,2,entry massive encyclopedia taoism write christine mollier beidou northern dipper early time northern dipper ursa major play fundamental role chinese official religious life importance astrocalendrical calculation mighty apotropaic power basic feature role taoism apparent han period shiji record historian trans chavannes 1895–1905 339 dipper associate pole star heavenly center world residence great \*taiyi rotation divide world palace \*jiugong dipper rule heaven earth symbolize complex unity cosmos earthly counterpart mount \*kunlun axis world human body dipper locate center level head heart navel relate one \*sanyi associate spleen organ relate soil center \*wuxe pattern color soil yellow alchemical text dipper yellow star huangxe synonyms yellow dame huangpo dipper lie north symbolize origin embrace beginning end subsume yin yang term describe dipper quality origin pivot universe day return origin huiyuan consecrate dipper double nature link life death associate idea passage divide good evil grant punishment reward symbol represent connection unity multiplicity closely related dipper consist star number great yang taiyang totality star locate scoop handle invisible fig call assistant strict condition purity enjoy life span year star inhabit divinity enclose paradise similar moon sun accord text star counterpart form invisible constellation surround supplementary star illuminate dipper celestial yang earthly yin soul \*hun dipper inhabit spouse king human body spirit black star reside hall light \*mingtang locate brain title suggest function protect embryo celestial world appear invert female yin dark entity outside male yang luminous one fact dipper say natural fire contain yin taoism dipper major role relate dual aspect dipper indicate proper orientation perform meditation ritual apparent movement handle second strong exorcistic power divinity north underworld adept example cover star visualize descend directly head surround analogously thunder ritual \*leifa thunder summon direction dipper point call gate vital force \*mingmen order expel demon dipper recipient invocation ask forgiveness sin erase register death siji fourth open way heaven seventh star call tianguan heavenly pass meditation ritual place framework exercise purpose unify adept deity pertain practice guard \*shouyi well know exercise walk guideline \*bugang frequently relate practice spread open barrier heaven tianguan kroll 1986b,5,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,Philosophical Exploration,0.9872,,,positive

1kjir3b,mrn679s,t3_1kjir3b,Lao_Tzoo,"Keep in mind hard/easy, and other measurements, are a mental imposition we impose upon events. 

We fix a  goal within our mind and then assign an emotional value upon achieving this goal. 

Then, whenever we measure our performance with imposed emotional value against the goal and find ourselves falling short of the goal, we experience displeasure expressed as unhappiness, frustration, anger, etc. 

The idea is to develop the mental skill of setting a goal, or purpose, absent our imposition of emotional attachment to the outcome. 

That is, deciding we emotionally ""need"" the outcome we wish before we allow ourselves to be content. 

Think of it this way, 

A river doesn't ""try"" to flow to the Sea. It merely follows its natural course, its path, and allows the outcome to be what the outcome becomes. 

In the same way, there is a certain process for humans achieving a decided upon goal. 

It is a pattern of practicing the required skills that are necessary in order to obtain that goal. 

When we apply ourselves to the skill practice, keeping the end goal in mind, but absent mental and emotional interference, or insisting upon our specified outcome, we allow the skill practice process to work for us unobstructed by our mental interference, and the outcome occurs naturally, as a consequence of the process.

>**功成而弗居 Achieves his goal but claims no credit.** 

>**夫唯弗居 Just because he claims no credit,** 

>**是以不去 His credit does not go away.**

>**Commentary:-**

>**In the first stanza Laozi is making a couple of statements that may sound contradictory or even absurd at first. But, upon closer examination, they turn out to be wise discernment of the truths in life. Such statements are paradoxes, and by invoking paradoxes Laozi teaches us how to transcend the differences forged by the human mind and be at peace with Nature’s creations. For example, Nature or Dao created the “ten thousand things under Heaven” without making distinctions between the ugly and the beautiful, the good and the not good. It is only we humans who created such distinctions. It is we humans who crave for the beautiful and good and loathe the ugly and the not good. Such cravings and loathing lead to strife and agony, and that in itself is ugly and not good.** 

>**Following the two paradoxes about beauty and good versus ugliness and not good, Laozi posits one of mankind’s first cracks at relativity—the interdependence of opposites such as Being versus Nonbeing, easy versus difficult, long versus short, and so on. “Music and voice,” by the way, refers to instrumental and vocal music. Then, in one of Laozi’s characteristic sequences, marked by his use of “therefore” and “thus” and “that is why,” he teaches us how to follow the sage’s behavior accordingly. Given the received order of the chapters, this is Laozi’s first mention of his hero 圣人 (shèng rén) or “sage.” To Laozi, the sage is not so much a moral exemplar as someone who is endowed with the wisdom to get things done without any arbitrary or self-serving action. Such a notion of wise “Non-doing” or “not doing,” known as 无为 (wú wéi), is going to become a leitmotif that runs throughout the pages of this book, but here the author seems to throw it out casually as if it was a familiar term, suggesting that he is probably not the first user of the expression. However, Laozi does go on to elaborate what he means by “Non-doing” or “not doing” and clinches the point by a guaranteed reward: “Just because he claims no credit, his credit does not go away.” This closing sentence strongly suggests that Laozi’s philosophy is not just about pure metaphysics or ethics but has the applicative value of gaining the desired result with the least effort.** 

>**A word may be said about “teaching without speaking” or “teaching without words.” Posterity has ridiculed Laozi by citing his work of five thousand words as rebuttal to his own principle. While recognizing the ineffability of Dao as the sage implies, we need not take his words literally and attempt a total denial of the role of words in teaching.(Charles Q.Wu)**",1,1746909195.0,0,translation provide link strange inaccurate relatively speak direct translation chinese charles wu:- 天下皆知美之为美 heaven know beauty beauty 斯惡矣 ugliness 皆知善之为善 know good good 斯不善矣 good 有无相生 nonbee generate 难易相成 difficult easy complement 长短相形 long short form 高下相傾 high low depend 音声相和 music voice harmonize 前後相随 rear follow constant 圣人处无为之事 sage handle affair non wuwei 行不言之教 practice teaching speak 万物作而弗始 let thing happen initiate 生而弗有 let grow possess 为而弗恃 get thing advantage 功成而弗居 achieve goal claim credit 夫唯弗居 claim credit 是以不去 credit away commentary:- stanza laozi make couple statement sound contradictory absurd close examination turn wise discernment truth life statement paradox invoke paradox laozi teach transcend difference forge human mind peace nature creation example nature dao create thousand thing heaven make distinction ugly beautiful good good human create distinction human crave beautiful good loathe ugly good craving loathing lead strife agony ugly good follow paradox beauty good versus ugliness good laozi posit mankind crack relativity interdependence opposite versus nonbeing easy versus difficult long versus short music voice way refer instrumental vocal music laozi characteristic sequence mark use teach follow sage behavior accordingly give receive order chapter laozi mention hero shèng rén sage laozi sage moral exemplar endow wisdom thing arbitrary self serve action notion wise non know wéi go leitmotif run page book author throw casually familiar term suggest probably user expression laozi elaborate mean non clinch point guarantee reward claim credit credit away closing sentence strongly suggest laozi philosophy pure metaphysics ethic applicative value gain desire result effort word say teaching speak teach word posterity ridicule laozi cite work thousand word rebuttal principle recognize ineffability dao sage imply need word literally attempt total denial role word teaching.(charles,21,Taoist Philosophy on Naturalness and Virtue,Philosophical Exploration,0.9965,,,positive

Much of the modern and Western writing on Eastern practice subjects tends to dilute or distort the original teachings—often reinterpreting them to fit contemporary frameworks or personal philosophies. As a result, key nuances are lost, and the depth of the tradition is compromised. For those who truly wish to understand these systems, it's essential to study the original texts in their native language. While modern Mandarin is helpful, it's important to recognize that many classical texts are written in Classical Chinese, which differs significantly in grammar, vocabulary, and style from the modern vernacular.

It's also worth noting that many of these classical manuscripts were intentionally written in cryptic, symbolic, or riddle-like language. This was a deliberate measure by the masters of the time to guard esoteric knowledge from the uninitiated—much like the veiled language used in Western alchemical texts. Understanding these works requires not just a grasp of Classical Chinese, but also a contextual awareness of the culture, philosophy, and oral traditions in which they were embedded.

With this context, it's easier to understand how modern and Western writers may have misinterpreted or oversimplified the original manuscripts.

Taiji put in easy terms, is advanced qigong with energy cultivation.

The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.

These two spring from the same source but differ in name;

Darkness within darkness.

3. Taoist cultivation practices and martial arts: Qigong, Tai Chi, Kung Fu

4. ""Be like water"" - famous quote by pop culture icon Bruce Lee, who popularized daoist philosophy/spirituality

5. The recent film ""Everything everywhere all at once""

6. Zhuangzi, 4th century philosopher and philosophical texts 

Master Dongguo asked Zhuangzi, “This thing called the Way—where does it exist?”
Zhuangzi, said, “There’s no place it doesn’t exist.”
“Come,” said Master Dongguo, “you must be more specific!”
“It is in the ant.”
“As low a thing as that?”
“It is in the panic grass.”
“But that’s lower still!”
“It is in the tiles and shards.”
“How can it be so low?”
“It is in the piss and shit!”

Personally I have a deep gratitude for qigong, I practiced yoga for many years and still do which also brought practices and philosophies into my life that have deeply helped me, but in a time I found myself in a kind of existential crises where it wasn't able to help me with my anxiety, qigong's different approach to energy helped me achieve more ballance. 
(This is absolutely in no way a diss on yoga, or saying one is better or worse, both are vast groups of systems with huge history, internal variety and incredible merit. Some things are somewhat similar or mirrored in them in ways that seem subtle and profound, and it is in a way the differences that have helped me greatly)

For headaches even some of the simplest qigong moving and breathing forms have helped me.

1kjl8ax,mrozjom,t3_1kjl8ax,OldDog47,"To me, the great lesson of Dao is how to view life and live life in a way that allows me to be at peace and harmony with the course of living. I've come to see the meaning and purpose of life is simply to live it. 

In order to do that, one needs to develop a degree of selflessness ... to consider others before oneself. There is no end to and no satisfying the self-centered desires that the mind can manufacture.  If all of one's time and effort is consumed chasing selfish desires, there will be no peace and harmony with the course of living.

Is Dao the answer? I think it can be if approached in the right manner. In certain Daoist meditation approaches, the first step is to believe. That is, have faith that there is something to it, even though not readily apparent. Such a faith allows one to move on to the next step. It is the initial inspiration that draws one into the practice. It is not really a rational thing ... more of an intuitive feeling. 

Undertaking the journey with Dao requires a bit of a leap of faith. As already pointed out, it is not a goal but a process ... an ongoing process. Repeated readings of the classic texts ... Laozi, Zhuangzi,  Liezi and others, by different translators ... over time, teaches one to see life and being differently. 

Just a few thoughts. Hope you can find them helpful.

Enso Circle: Letting go of the mind

by The Editorial Team

 

 August 29, 2023

According to Japanese, as we search to find meaning and purposes in our lives, certain concepts and symbols can help us. One of the most effective symbols is the Enso Circle, a Japanese “circle” that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes and used in Zen to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create.

The Ensō circle represents our true and innermost self. The Enso circle, which can be open or closed, symbolizes an expression of life, showing both the beginning and end. It’s also used to express absolute enlightenment, strength, elegance, the universe and the wuji (the void).

The Enso is a popular symbol of Buddhism and Japanese calligraphy that is made with a single brushstroke that creates an unclosed circle. It’s also called the Infinity Circle, Japanese Circle, Zen Circle or the Circle of Enlightenment.

In essence, it exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese wabi-sabi perspective and aesthetic:

Fukinsei (asymmetry, irregularity)

Kanso (simplicity)

Koko (basic; weathered)

Shizen (without pretense; natural)

Yugen (subtly profound grace)

Datsuzoku (freedom)

Seijaku (tranquility)

 Regaining a spiritual and mental balance

The goal of this circle is to free the mind from thoughts of anger and fear. This freedom from paradoxical mindfulness can improve well-being as well as help you to enter a state of flow.

The point of it is deeply personal. Represents a spiritual and mental balance more than anything else. Depending on the artist’s intentions, you will encounter Ensō Circles left slightly open or entirely closed.

There are many different meanings about the Enso. According to many people, the white circle can indicate emptiness, or it can take on the idea that it contains all it needs within its center. On a social level, the Enso circle can be seen to symbolize harmonious cooperation between one another.

Furthermore, maybe the circle illustrates the cyclic nature of life: birth, death, and rebirth. Even seasons go through this cyclic process.

In meditation, the Enso indicates the perfect meditative state in which your mind is detached from all and in connection with the infinite. It provides a sense of calm, concentration, and rejuvenation.

1ki84ii,mrl9ahh,t1_mrivprr,berf,"Tao (or Dao) is a chinese character (word) that translates many ways.  The simplest is way.  It can mean path but also (metaphorically) a way of doing things.  There are as many daos as there are things to do and people to woof about how to do them.  The same Chinese character can serve as either a noun or a verb (and does in the first line of the Daodejing, where it occurs 3 times, 2 as noun, 1 as verb).  As a verb it means serve as a path or way of doing things or as a guide.  Unlike English, there is no marker of singular or plural, so you don't know whether to translate as way or ways (or method or methods or whatever) and there is no notion of count nouns or mass nouns (so you don't know whether to say the dao or just dao, maybe it is a mass noun like water, you just say there is water in the glass, not the water).  So the translation if we take ""dao"" as more or less untranslatable is dao [that] can dao is not unchanging dao.  Now you apply all of that uncertainty about what dao can mean here.

I also recall Hansen writing somewhere that he agreed with Guo Xiang's position of rejecting a singular metaphysical Dao, though sadly, I don't remember the source.

I'm changing the subject a little, but this is what Brook Ziporyn had to say about Guo Xiang's interpretation of Dao (which he translates as ""Course"") amongst other things:-

>**GUO XIANG (252–312). Responsible for editing the original fifty-five chapter version of the Zhuangzi down to the current thirty-three chapter version, Guo Xiang is also the most influential of all its commentators, his work later being treated as the de facto “official” commentary when the text came to be recognized as canonical in imperial collections. His commentary is based closely on Xiang Xiu’s lost work, to the point of raising suspicions of plagiarism. All later commentators may be assumed to have studied Guo’s commentary closely. Guo’s staunchly anti-metaphysical, antifoundationalist, and anti-theistic interpretation of Zhuangzi rejects any notion of the Course as creator or source of beings, and with it any ontological hierarchy between Heaven and Man or between the Course and things. Instead, he stresses the concept of spontaneity, or “self-so,” (ziran, ) reading Zhuangzi’s Course as literally nonbeing, so that claims of the Course’s creation of things are to be understood as meaning that nothing interferes with the self-so self-creation, and also intrinsic rightness, of each individual thing. “Self-so” is the antonym of deliberate activity and of the purposive knowledge that goes with it. All deliberate activity, in Guo’s view, is based on the “traces” left by one particular self-so event on another, which come to inspire conscious esteem and emulation, thereby interfering with the self-so process that functions in the absence of cognitions, ideals, explicit values, and deliberate endeavors. Guo often interprets against the grain of the surface meaning of the Zhuangzi text, particularly when it is satirical or critical of Confucian sages or when it seems to advocate withdrawal from active involvement in the world of affairs. For Guo, the critiques in the text are merely of the sages’ “traces,” not of the sages themselves, who were themselves perfectly merged into their own self-so and thus perfectly right in all their deeds, but who thereby unfortunately, through no fault of their own, came to be valued and emulated by later people, thereby undermining and disturbing the self-so rightness of these misguided admirers. Guo’s expositions on the theme of the self-so, and his uncompromising relativism, remain unsurpassed among Zhuangzi’s commentators.**",1,1746975085.0,7,recall rebuttal scholar critical chad hansen reject singular metaphysical dao recall hansen writing agree guo xiang position reject singular metaphysical dao sadly remember source change subject little brook ziporyn guo xiang interpretation dao translate course things:- guo xiang 252–312 responsible edit original chapter version zhuangzi current thirty chapter version guo xiang influential commentator work later treat facto official commentary text come recognize canonical imperial collection commentary base closely xiang xiu lose work point raise suspicion plagiarism later commentator assume study guo commentary closely guo staunchly anti metaphysical antifoundationalist anti theistic interpretation zhuangzi reject notion course creator source being ontological hierarchy heaven man course thing instead stress concept spontaneity self ziran read zhuangzi course literally nonbeing claim course creation thing understand mean interfere self self creation intrinsic rightness individual thing self antonym deliberate activity purposive knowledge go deliberate activity guo view base trace leave particular self event come inspire conscious esteem emulation interfere self process function absence cognition ideal explicit value deliberate endeavor guo interpret grain surface meaning zhuangzi text particularly satirical critical confucian sage advocate withdrawal active involvement world affair guo critique text merely sage trace sage perfectly merge self perfectly right deed unfortunately fault come value emulate later people undermine disturb self rightness misguided admirer guo exposition theme self uncompromise relativism remain unsurpassed zhuangzi commentator,5,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,Philosophical Exploration,0.9348,,,positive

1ki8rfn,mrla3wd,t3_1ki8rfn,deleted,"A pleasing exercise that may or may not be in the spirit of the Dao De Ching is to think about the connotations of words. How do those words make you feel. What are the genre associations with each word? Do you rank them in some way? Do some make you feel more judged, or are some more friendly? 

With words like ""God"", especially for someone of a religious nature in the west, that word may have very important connotations -- either institutionally or else in terms of emotional ones. This may depend on whether they were raised to feel one way or the other about religion itself, even. Consider how many words exist for something like ""the universal spirit that gives life to the world"". How one feels about each word for this in each language might depend entirely on their relationship to the religious community (or their idea of it) in their own society. 

When reading the Dao De Ching, I get the idea that one is maybe supposed to consider weighing what words mean in their mind beyond the literal conversational value they have for communicating a well defined idea amongst people who don't think together (and thus must rely on definitions commonly agreed upon, unless they are of a mind on subtext somehow). Considering what words mean in their mind, are there things you can't express about them in words very easily? Are there feelings and ways of connection that don't have an easy definition in words, altho you can imagine how they feel in the tactile or graphical sense? Are there things beyond even that which you don't have a name for? Reading such a book in English, twice or thrice translated from an ancient language, one almost has to do that anyways -- how much neater that the fellow may have been interested in that idea himself, unless I have projected it on him from afar. 

Anyways, ""God"" is a super loaded word that may carry connotations that are very hard to describe in any language. These connotations may have a ""feel"" that is hard to give any other word to. For others, perhaps they feel that no such word can every carry the connotations they imagine when they deeply reflect on their benevolent spirit(s), or that none can do them justice. For others still, perhaps the exercise is to consider the connotations of a word, how those connection change over time and lead to other words, and how they are similar to the feelings evokes by non-verbal reality; and thus hone in on what does not change over time: the feeling identified, rather than the word which was linked to it. All of those things are valuable and practiced by both some Daoists and some Buddhists.

1kh2vbx,mrl3vxc,t1_mr3wghu,az4th,"Yang is spirit, shen. 

Find something that makes you feel alive, gives you purpose. Something that feels real, a part of your destiny, something that is uniquely you. Something that helps you return to oneness of all things. This comes of harmonizing with all, and dissolving division as an illusion, seeing beyond the mundane and reconnecting with the true. 

That's what begins to connect you back to your spirit. And then helps spirit to gather within you. 

But it is really you, gathering yourself, back to connection with all, as you leave behind your divisions.

We can't have energy if we separate ourselves from it. 

Sure, there are yang kinds of things. Vitamin D, iodine, caffeine. But they will metabolize the yang out of our reserves, and leave us with less capacity (yin) to contain the energy (yang). Our quality of sleep goes down as our yin can no longer contain our yang, and we quickly age. 

Reversing this, we clear out, create more healthy capacity within us, let our minds go, stop sexual waste, and learn to use our vitality to circulate creative energy within us, before it tries to leak out into sexual activity. These days so many people either waste their vitality with sexual addictions, or do the opposite and try to store it up without metabolizing it in beneficial ways. By three months of storing, people go back to the other extreme unless they have found a way to utilize the creative energy. Tai Chi, meditation, physical activity can all help with this. 

But then too, whenever we are metabolizing our vitality (jing) up, we never want to deplete it. That is our water. We want to circulate it and nourish it, and use it, but not to the point of depletion. If one is already wasting it with sexual habits, and then working themselves out to the point of depletion, and doing nothing meaningful to their cultivate their spirit and their soul, then where is the life in that?

1kg49rc,mqvrx6l,t3_1kg49rc,Lao_Tzoo,"As an agreement and confirmation, here is a type of meditation I've recommended for perhaps 20 years or so, and on Reddit many times in the past 5 years or so:

""As with many things in life there are many methods. Different ones work better for different people according to their personality, inclinations, and natural talents. My favorite is a variation of counting breaths.

I don't like counting breaths because it involves discursive thought, that is, concentrating with words and we want to transcend words, and it also involves meeting a goal, that is, counting. 

People then worry about counting and losing count and wandering mind while counting etc. Then they waste energy worrying about whether they are doing it correctly or not. 

What I have come up with is what I call rhythmic breathing.

Sit comfortably, or lay down. Comfort is the goal. You will inhale and exhale through the nose. Inhale deeply using abdominal breathing or yogic complete breathing. It doesn't matter which, as long as you can breath deeply.

Inhale deeply to your comfort level. Hold the breath to your comfort level. Exhale to your comfort level. Hold the exhalation to your comfort level. Then inhale again and continue. This forms a natural rhythm of your own. 

There is no set time or rhythm. It is entirely up to you. Each breath/hold cycle will vary from one cycle to the other. That is okay. It doesn't matter. It's your rhythm. 

The only goal is to not consciously set a goal/pattern and be comfortable. If you need an extra deep breath, take it. If it is comfortable to hold longer this time than last time, fine. 

Think of each breath cycle as similar to waves on the beach. Inhale wave comes in, pause, exhale wave goes out, pause, etc. Sometimes I'll even visualize waves on the beach.

The waves at the beach have their own rhythm, but it is a variable rhythm. It is rhythmic, but always changing, just like your breath. 

You will find your breathing sounds like waves at the beach as well. As you exhale feel the mental tension go out with the waves.

Then just relax, feel and enjoy your own natural rhythm.""",79,1746538596.0,0,agreement confirmation type meditation recommend year reddit time past year thing life method different one work well different people accord personality inclination natural talent favorite variation count breath like count breath involve discursive thought concentrate word want transcend word involve meet goal count people worry count lose count wandering mind count etc waste energy worry correctly come rhythmic breathing sit comfortably lie comfort goal inhale exhale nose inhale deeply abdominal breathing yogic complete breathing matter long breath deeply inhale deeply comfort level hold breath comfort level exhale comfort level hold exhalation comfort level inhale continue form natural rhythm set time rhythm entirely breath hold cycle vary cycle okay matter rhythm goal consciously set goal pattern comfortable need extra deep breath comfortable hold long time time fine think breath cycle similar wave beach inhale wave come pause exhale wave go pause etc visualize wave beach wave beach rhythm variable rhythm rhythmic change like breath find breathing sound like wave beach exhale feel mental tension wave relax feel enjoy natural rhythm,3,Breathing Techniques and Meditation,Practical Taoism,0.9689,NEUTRAL,0.5454381108283997,positive

1kg49rc,mqx5jh8,t3_1kg49rc,MelloYelloEmperor,"I'm reading several different books on meditation before I take it on, to ensure I understand all the points. This is so I don't waste 30 years only to find out that I was doing it wrong for the first 20.

Wuwei is not ""non-action."" It's a state of being. Similar to being so adept at a skill that you're not consciously aware that you're doing it. Like when you drive to work, but then don't remember how you got there.

So it's not about eliminating everything but breath awareness when trying to meditate. It's about becoming so adept in all the aspects of meditation that you forget you're doing them. As I understand it, there are 4 main points to meditation:

Alignment: This is primarily concerned with skeletal alignments while sitting or standing so that you are properly aligned with gravity. Here you feel an upward pull on the bai hui point. The focus is on your bones basically hanging from here like a marionette. The skull floats, as if from a coat hanger, while everything below is pulled down like a garment on that hanger.

Relaxation: ""Song"" is a Chinese word for relaxation that is difficult to describe. Essentially this is a continuation of the alignment step, where you feel a downward pull of gravity on your fleshy parts, meaning your skin, muscles, tendons, and internal organs. Here is where you sink your breath into whatever body part is ""stuck"" and won't relax. You breathe into it until the tension leaves. Try getting a deep tissue massage from a skilled therapist. Odds are they will find a spot that is painful. Have them adjust their pressure, but stay on that point and breath through that pain until it releases. This is the essence of the concept. Healthy tissue should not hurt. This is why Bodhidharma wanted monks to train hard to bring about extreme health/circulation so that they could ignore their bodies for longer and meditate on deeper levels. You can feel this without the pain of deep tissue massage, by just aligning, relaxing and breathing into different areas of your body. But the massage will help you understand the concept faster. The sense of release will be felt in the body. Your muscles will twitch as your brain rewires itself and you will feel a sense of relief and deeper breathing. This is Song. The focus is on relaxing into, and feeling, your body. You are still using your brain and nervous system for this. But not in the same way as when you do trigonometry or looking for tax loopholes... this is cognitive thought. Feeling is also a thought.

Stillness: Essentially harmonization of the mind/body so that there is no experience of a ""you"" that is separate from everything else around you.

Absorption: This is a deeper level of stillness where the brain gradually loses the anxiety of dissociation and settles into ever deeper levels of stillness.

I'll leave points open for debate. But it should be something to this effect. When in doubt, go on a journey, talk to different people, read all the books and develop your own concepts.

Edit: a deepening of the breath comes from a deepening of body awareness or relaxation into the body (and vice versa). At higher levels of attainment the skin begins to breathe deeper as your awareness extends beyond your body. This is usually when cultivators have to leave society and head for wilderness to avoid society's constant insult to the senses.",3,1746553062.0,0,read different book meditation ensure understand point waste year find wrong wuwei non action state similar adept skill consciously aware like drive work remember get eliminate breath awareness try meditate adept aspect meditation forget understand main point meditation alignment primarily concerned skeletal alignment sit stand properly align gravity feel upward pull bai hui point focus bone basically hang like marionette skull float coat hanger pull like garment hanger relaxation song chinese word relaxation difficult describe essentially continuation alignment step feel downward pull gravity fleshy part mean skin muscle tendon internal organ sink breath body stuck relax breathe tension leave try get deep tissue massage skilled therapist odd find spot painful adjust pressure stay point breath pain release essence concept healthy tissue hurt bodhidharma want monk train hard bring extreme health circulation ignore body long meditate deep level feel pain deep tissue massage align relax breathe different area body massage help understand concept fast sense release feel body muscle twitch brain rewire feel sense relief deep breathing song focus relax feel body brain nervous system way trigonometry look tax loophole cognitive thought feeling thought stillness essentially harmonization mind body experience separate absorption deep level stillness brain gradually lose anxiety dissociation settle deep level stillness leave point open debate effect doubt journey talk different people read book develop concept edit deepening breath come deepening body awareness relaxation body vice versa high level attainment skin begin breathe deep awareness extend body usually cultivator leave society head wilderness avoid society constant insult sense,3,Breathing Techniques and Meditation,Practical Taoism,0.5589,,,positive
1kg49rc,mqw0tzg,t3_1kg49rc,P_S_Lumapac,"It's one very low level meditation. You can do it forever and get some benefit, but if you're not doing deeper kinds of meditation you are limiting yourself. It's a bit like saying you want to become an athlete, but you don't go past walking.

It absolutely will not get you toward any kind of enlightenment I've heard of.

Along you meditation journey, you can ask yourself a bunch of questions about your mental skills. (if you have visual imagination) Can you imagine so vividly that you're all but in another place? Can you choose to be in bliss or terror or romance within a few minutes of effort? Can you control your emotions under sudden and surprise pressures? Can you control your heart rate, pupil dilation, sweat, hunger and thirst - and can you do so under stress? There's a million million routes, but finishing a stage is almost always marked by unusual skill.

For breath and silent meditation, the speed of entering and the experience of time rushing, are good measures of skill. For instance, can you meditate while making coffee? Can you meditate for an 8 hour flight? I'm not saying these are the only ends of this silent meditation type - just, if you haven't achieved these, you're nowhere near the end of that single step.

It's also really important to know that humans can hypnostise themselves with repetitive actions like praying or chanting or throwing a ball against a wall. You'll run out of all the benefit you will ever get from this in a couple hours. It's a massive trap to keep repeating the same skill thinking you are getting better at some deeper skill. It reminds me a little of terrible drivers who deny it by saying how they've been driving for 20 years!

When focusing the breath your giving it something to do preventing more of the natural wandering. Like telling you    ""quickly don't think of a purple duck"" is more likely to invoke thoughts of a purple duck than any other thought.  By watching your breath you leave less room for your mind to wander. Next breathing techniques, and watching ones breath are only small pieces to meditation. There is the awareness of mind, of body, of spirit. What you have seemingly done was take one step forward and announced ""I have reached the finish line"" when the race just started. You know what watching your breathing does? It helps you to train your ability to focus and become aware making things like becoming aware of the energy swirling in ones dan tian. The first step isn't a bad one per say but to call it anything more than a first step is disconcerting. You know why breathing techniques exist? Breathing techniques come from specific practices. From box breathing to Kapalabhati and so many others these breathing techniques arose for purposes. Breathing techniques typically work by flooding the brain with more oxygen which improves things like thought. If breathing techniques were unnecessary why would they have survived this long? Breath is spirit? You understand oxygen to be the spirit of? I mean nothing in the Tao Te Ching which is like the only book westerners read mentions little to nothing on this topic. Meditation is not mentioned as a taoist practice which it isn't. A taoist will typically meditate but nothing says to meditate. Meditation comes from the culture.

1kg49rc,mrkrpm5,t3_1kg49rc,deleted,"Interestingly, English translations of Lao Tzu differ on this. Feng's translation says negative things about ""controlling the breath"" while Cleary's translation of Takuan's translation doesn't even mention breath in the same chapter. It's hard to reconcile so many different translations, but that's a great book.

While I don't know much about Daoism, it seems unlikely to me that Lao Tzu didn't value the healing and meditative value of breathing, in terms of awarenes. His book is full of recommendations to observe the subtle in consciousness, thought, and action, in order to be more deeply aware -- unless I've read it wrong. When I read that book it's definitely the vibe I get. 

It is actually one of those fundamental things in every tradition, which pays obvious dividends. If you dig deeply into basically any spiritual tradition, you'll find somebody wise recommending syllables and words of power, mantras (which can be used while *breathing in* for super pleasing results -- one can find such words literally scattered around the world, or play with syllables), breathing techniques, pranayama-like things, etc. Recommending one be aware of the parts of the throat, tongue, and mouth, aim for the root chakra, find the centerline, let both of your eyes relax, think about your nostrils, the tip of the nose, the little muscles on the top of the nose near the eyes; let your mouth relax into a little smile or focus on the corners of the mouth without tension, etc. From Buddhism to the Abrahamic traditions and everywhere in between and around, there's always somebody wise recommending it. Not only is it one of the best ways to cultivate awareness, but it's also a fantastic way to reset one's form after something physically or mentally vigorous. Even Musashi speaks of this, actually. I have a habit of scrunching the right side of my face when writing or using my phone, and it has been a good habit to use these techniques to reset my face after such activities (one's whole balance depends more on their face than they know). And to great effect, actually. While skating I've got a whole arsenal or breathing tricks that let me go hard. Aiming for the pelvis allows one to stimulate the legs and the hips. It's one of life's greatest things. There is real power in it, and it's weird to me that these things are not taught in grade school. Once I began playing with these ideas I immediately recognized them in the religious community's more esoteric side, and now I've got like a side hobby of finding that stuff in as many books as I can.

Note that not every language seems to have the same holes in them. The semitic 'kh' sound which, when breathing in, is great for the little muscles in the deeper throat. 'ng' as in ya*ng* is great for hitting some angles (especially after a yin that hits the nostrils). The word for ""water"" in most languages is a good one. Each vowel and consonant is useful in it's own way. For those who want to make these things part of their daily life, practicing them as one practices martial arts moves or anything athletic will build muscle memory, and they will become second nature. For writers, in particular, who may spend a lot of time staring with a side-eye while exercising their writing hand, or anyone else who builds dominance on one side over the other over time with their activities, these techniques are valuable in bringing balance to the body so that they can continue to do those things without settling into a bad local minimum. 

But I'm not an expert. Just my two cents. Almost every religious book on the planet is filled with this stuff.

So, this is more of a description of ""just breathing"" rather than an outline of rules. 

So, if we say, ""just feel the breath"" the way we word this gives the appearance of an instruction, or rule to follow. 

Rather, it is meant to be a description of what occurs naturally when we pay attention to our breathing without imposing ideas goals, rules and distractions. 

All that is left is the breathing and our observing of it. 

Even the complete, or yogic breathing, is unnecessary and gives the appearance of a rule. 

We deep breathe because it gives a more complete filling of the lungs which provides a greater overall long-term benefit, than constant shallow breathing. 

So, we do it because it's healthy not because it's necessary for concentration, or meditation. 

Shorter, shallower breaths are fine and we aren't doing anything wrong when we do this. 

I get allergies every winter. If I try to breathe too deeply i cough 10 or 20 times, which interferes with relaxing and just breathing. 

So, we accommodate ourselves to what is possible to do comfortably. 

When I can breathe more deeply, I do, when I can't, I don't.

I've skimmed the work and didn't find anything outside of histories and practices. Some parts aren't clear if he's making truth claims or just repeating what his buddhism tells him.

For instance ""the way into stillness"" has this part:

""Thus one cannot will the mind to be still.""

Which is plainly false, as that's a medium level skill in meditation. It might take a couple weeks to learn. But am I supposed to think he's just a poor practitioner or am I supposed to think this is just buddhist teaching? Before that is a metaphor about trying to hold a leaf still, the leaf still moves somewhat - so it sounds a little like he's trying to explain a teaching. Or is he being serious? Does he genuinely think humans can't will themselves into stillness?

Maybe there's a work he's done for buddhists that goes into his own thoughts, so it's clear what has convinced you of his enlightenment.

EDIT: the next section about lights is just funny.

""Although the following advice is for accomplished meditators only, by which I mean those with plentiful experience of jhāna already, it is included here for the sake of completeness. When one is skillful in entering into jhāna and one has experienced a jhāna recently, the mind is so still and powerful, even before one begins to meditate, that one may skip many stages. So much so that one may arouse the nimitta almost immediately after starting. The mind, being so used to nimittas and so favorably disposed toward them, literally leaps onto the nimitta and the nimitta stays. Soon jhāna is reached. For such accomplished meditators, the earlier the nimitta arises, the better.""

Seeing a vivid light independent of your will is a low level meditation skill. This might take a matter of hours to learn. I guess he's saying having this come easy is a good mark of someone who almost has the skill to hold onto blissful states? I doubt it. Having lights like this comes much sooner than being able to choose your emotional states. Blissful states take maybe a month or two of work while seeing lights you could probably get started in one session. Maybe a week to turn them on and off at will, but you'd be better off learning to conjour whole places in that time.

In Daoism it means a bunch of things, with Wang Bi giving the clearest definition as understanding the eternal (the principles behind principles - something like logic or conservation laws but in his metaphysics too). The idea being, if you understood this you would be great at various positions like ruler or teacher.

If I'm just taking that book as his reports of his own meditation abilities (and I really doubt that, as my guess is he has gone far beyond what he's in my edit describing as ""accomplished meditators"" given he's dedicated his life to it) then he's a completely ordinary meditator with no special knowledge or abilities. He's not really close to a candidate for an enlightened person in any sense.

If by partial enlightenment you mean he has made progress towards gaining special abilities or wisdom or states of being, sure, I don't see him as particularly far along that path.

The highest good is like water.
Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive.
It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao.
In dwelling, be close to the land.
In meditation, go deep in the heart.
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.
In speech, be true.
In ruling, be just.
In business, be competent.
In action, watch the timing.
No fight: No blame.


As a bonus we even get a nice little message about the focus of meditation.


Everyone must learn their own lessons on their own? Really? So children learn their ABCs without influence? Children learn colors without interference? Does a martial artist become so on their own? I can agree all knowledge comes from the Tao however if all things are Tao than information from all sources is information that comes from the tao no?


Again still haven't pointed out how I attacked you. You say I attacked you by representing what your biased cognition says is misinformation. Is someone who is truly a practitioner so flimsy that anyone who doesn't agree with you seen as an attack?


A beginner sure I will take this title because in the grand scale of things a person practicing for roughly 10 years is nothing. Being dedicatedly taught for 2 years of that is but a heartbeat to the tao. The 8 years of collaborative teaching is but a breath on the way.


Next let's work through some logic here which I will presume these to be truths. Tao is like water. Water in tao te ching is said to flow to the lowest points. The water in our world moves towards the seas which are the lowest points. Water pools in areas other than the seas. Gutters, gullues, holes, divets ect... Sitting in these pools it reenters the cycle of rain. When it enters the seas it mixes with all the other waters which enter the sea. Now presume this water can have consciousness their goal is to reach the seas. Would getting stuck and reentering the rain cycle be a failure or success. In fact neither because it is only a stop. Meditation is helped by focus and focusing on ones breath does help train the focus. However it's not the seas. Being present in the moment is the basis of meditation. Focusing on breathing is only focusing but a very small part of the present. What sounds are you ignoring because your focused on the breath? What sensations are you missing because your focused on something different. How present can you be while intentionally distracting your mind?


Finally to answer the question of my word choice of should. It is a choice to use softer language as I am only a student of roughly 10 years. Until I am one with the tao again can I truly speak with authority. Until then I use softer language than I used to.",1,1746619039.0,2,thing biased cognition show suggest work remember correctly fact know partial practice meditation helpful find teacher practice breathe technique siren hushi natural breathing nihushi reverse breathing embryonic breathing dantian breathing admit originally book knowledge breathing thought final product focus right apart tao proper english use tao action consequence wrong mean thing preferable sage say noble title despise tao ching specific wrong noble one title tao ching chapter high good like water water give life thousand thing strive flow place man reject like tao dwelling close land meditation deep heart deal gentle kind speech true ruling business competent action watch timing fight blame bonus nice little message focus meditation learn lesson child learn abcs influence child learn color interference martial artist agree knowledge come tao thing tao information source information come tao point attack attack represent biased cognition say misinformation truly practitioner flimsy agree see attack beginner sure title grand scale thing person practice roughly year dedicatedly teach year heartbeat tao year collaborative teaching breath way let work logic presume truth tao like water water tao ching say flow low point water world move sea low point water pool area sea gutter gullue hole divet ect sit pool reenter cycle rain enter sea mix water enter sea presume water consciousness goal reach sea get stick reentere rain cycle failure success fact stop meditation help focus focus one breath help train focus sea present moment basis meditation focus breathing focus small present sound ignore focus breath sensation miss focus different present intentionally distract mind finally answer question word choice choice use soft language student roughly year tao truly speak authority use soft language,-1,,,0.9736,,,positive

Some of them are tall tales. 

I believe everything written in *Opening the Dragon Gate* is true. 

Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. 

When it comes to teachers, I tend to trust those who teach with subtleties and are not direct. For this reveals their shen cultivation. 

Teachers who boast about their righteousness and what is true or false, without showing evidence of the practice of a humility - true humility, not just saving face - reveal that they are not continuing to cultivate while they teach. 

Generally these things are best navigated by one's clear heart. 

But if one is not willing to trust their heart, it means their heart has not become clear. 

The heart and the mind are one - xin. And the heart is that which houses the shen. 

The path to finding true teachers, comes of the seeds planted in the heart - in the home of the shen.

(EDIT3: looks like I skipped a couple lines. Oh well, commentary is fine and I am sick of wrestling with reddit's table feature.).

""The dichotomy between the Tao of heaven and the Earth is confusing me. The the third line implies that they are talking about the Earth because it is long enduring. But the fourth line sounds like it is talking about the Tao of heaven""

So, it's saying nature has excelling parts and lasting parts, so nature can excel and last. Similarly, a person acting in a certain nature, can excel and last. It is stating this certain nature is not selfishness. Context: Elsewhere heaven and earth are called impartial (selfish is being partial to yourself). I think this also ties into the idea of heaven and earth being used by others, i.e. the use is not from its own desires, and so too the sage or higher person allows others to use them. (EDOT: just realised the author chucked in this reference themselves! Well I don't disagree but the text doesn't have that fifth line. )

Generally at the time, it was believed that acting in line with nature was good and all good stuff done told you something about nature. Each school was concerned with saying what nature was like by what it had, and Daoism gives the answer of nature being without this or that. Here, being without selfishness (being impartial) gives you the ultimate powers of heaven and earth i.e. excelling and lasting.

I think lasting also means withstanding, I'm not sure.

Hopefully breaking it down with parallels here helps see how the meaning is fairly straight forward.

EDIT: 不自生 can also be ""not self generate"" but it doesn't really fit the context so much. I think Selderij is also right that this part of the text can just be long lasting - a rule of translating that you look to context, would suggest that's either a good translation because it's the same as the adjective used on the similar thing earth, or a bad translation because the similar thing already has that reading covered. I would go for excel because well, it's true anyway elsewhere in the text and yeah the alternative is already covered. I probably would argue that parallel structures from the start are concerned with nourishing and achieving as overall themes, and achieving and nourishing here seem to fit the bill - so I'd argue the overall theme of the opening favors excel. No biggy either way.

EDIT2: the text continues with less clear parallels, something like:  
""so the sage stands at the back and so takes the lead, ignores his body and so it lasts, ignores his own private interests and so achieves them. "" note the question above about whether to read it as not selfish or not self generating, fairly clearly falls with ""not selfish"" if we consider the context of the later passages in the same part. I would guess the thrust is this final remark, so the two examples before are demonstrating the form of it. So ""just as ignoring your body keeps you healthy, stepping back has you take the lead, ignoring your own private interests achieves them"". How is that? I guess avoiding assuming something is wrong with you, avoiding assuming the answers, and stepping back as a leader has others step back - well when we step back and then others step back, we lead them but we didn't step back for that reason. So I guess the lesson is if we don't assume answers like what we want and how to get it, and instead let these desires be fullfilled as a natural reaction to our not posturing as having the answers here - that's how we get all our desires fulfilled. This is a plainly DDJ lesson, so I'm going with that for now.

I guess **Heaven lives long** I would put as heaven excels. Both work but this fits more thematically and structurally I think. Having it as Excels also fits the overall theme of heaven achieving and earth nourishing. Lives long and lasting are too similar - it could be right, but if it is right, what a missed opportunity for laozi, when the alternative reading that does more heavy lifting is right there. Also the second half, casts the sage as having two kinds of desires, one about leadership and one about living a long time, and while leadership could fit with the above... I think it fits with excels better.

And **Is that they do not will their own existence** I would put more as they don't act out of their selves, as it fits the second half more. I guess mainly, the second half ends more explicitly being about putting aside selfishness, but if you take the reading about coming from their own existence, the two conclusions aren't as clearly related. I also think elsewhere heaven and earth are called impartial and that's a pretty big part of the arguments imo, and my reading here fits that better.

I think this passage has very strong ""left right"" parallels as I tried to show, but those don't really play too big a role here. Maybe helps argue that excels is very different to lasting, as why else go to the trouble of making such a parallel if not to contrast differing things? But the passage also has strong ""top and bottom"" symmetry, where the second half repeats the structure for the argument to do with heaven, to show the argument to do with the sage. It is directly applying the argument about heaven and earth to sages, so I think saying these are to be interepreted as analogous in an important way. It is hard to believe the lines just before the conclusions are analogous in an important way if you go with Wu's reading (as I argued above).

Wu also means something like without, so I was making a pun. McTranslation is a better pun though.

EDIT: double checking on the 長, the excels reading also means something like older or mature. Wiktionary says the pictogram comes from ""an old man with long hair"". The second half of the argument is concerned with the sage being an unwitting leader (the sage living a long time I think has to be the long lasting one from Earth). They're a leader in that passage because of who they are not because of efforts to lead.

1kephmg,mqonsdp,t1_mqolkkz,P_S_Lumapac,"Well I like Wagner the most so that tracks.

Ziporyn I do give a lot of weight to. Everything I've read of theirs has been good.

I think with such a huge task in carefully translating the whole text, agreement doesn't really mean all that much towards whether I think it's a good translation. I'm far more impressed by anyone who can argue across the whole span of the work (and variations, and historical tidbits, commentaries etc). A good translation to me is one that has consistent translation rules, and Wu's one seems fine - I can't imagine a consistent set being used by McDonald or Mitchel unless ""vibes"" is a rule.

The only time I see a good translation and still don't like it is when I see a rule of ""well this is the common way of translating it so..."" as I think I often see with the opening line. Wagner actually does this. Throughout his works he discusses his translation rules and methods, and it's all very interesting, but there are spots where he just doesn't follow them. One of his rules is to just assume Wang Bi was always right and was reading the best version ever of the DDJ - he says this at the outset that there is this bias, so it's fine. My issue is there are parts where he clearly doesn't do this, and I really think the first line is one of them. My guess is he was picking his battles. I think it would be a rare scholar to stay successful in spite of going directly against widespread agreement, so maybe he thought the same and kept the low stakes passages (debatable) as received.

As cool as I think the historical and academic side is, my interest in the DDJ is that I genuinely think (at least when including Wang Bi's essay on it) the text is incredibly useful.

I'm not saying this because they come into conflict. Alls u gotta do is read the texts, its fairly obvious they do not advocate anywhere near the same level of things, nor does Confucianism make any real spiritual/ metaphysical insinuations beyond “learn through interaction or observation” 

Daoist value nature, find social roles and instituionlization to be restrictive and non valuable, spontaneous, ever changing/cretaed metaphysical perspectivism. Action through inaction. Anti authoritarian and anti political. Most importantly Daoism has the Dao which functions as a fundamental principle that works like flux from the Greeks, except even more fundamental. There is no judgement in the dao and it is amoral and spontaneous in nature. There is no right or wrong, no good or bad, no virtue. Daoism is paradoxical and extremely complicated in implication. Only thing close to daoism is Buddhism or Hinduism. Daoism preaches to let go of distinctions. The sage is truly themselves when they are completely empty, not even aware of what is. 

Confucians society, social heirachy, and harmonious society. They value compassion, ritual, and the concept of a virtuous person (completely arbitrary distinction used for manipulation as benevolent is used in religions). Pro government and pro society control. Most fundamentally Confucians believe there is a heaven which ordains the way that humans exist and that reality is inherently ethcial. There is good and bad, there is right and wrong, there is virtue. Confucianism has hardly any implications at this point, we've seen what they've displayed a thousand times over and in many different cultures. Confucianism preaches to observe and manipulate distinctions. The virtuous one is in control of what is. 


Chathoclics and protestants argue with each other about mostly non implicative theories that had already been discussed by ancient philosophers. They differ in church structure, who they think they should pray to, importance of baptism and communion and most importantly adherence to the pope. None of these things are actually that different and loaded with a ton of mysticism/ritual bs, not philosophical in nature a majority of the time. They make up the modern philosophers like 1600s-1800s who are a bunch of people that argue about “rational Christianity” because they're all trying to validate and differentiate their own sects. Descartes started off the party and the rest followed. They made some distinctions in human psychology and such but most of their metaphysical arguments were pretty moot and simple. Leibiniz (the basis for calculus through the conceptualization of moands) is most important, then people like Berekly (immaterialism, an already beat to death point)  and Hume (who notabley dropped the “bomb shell” in human psychology and gave psychological framework to the development of belief,  in a pretty obvious point that ancient Greeks had already discussed).",1,1746476758.0,7,statement absolutely alike lmao example simply true close say come conflict all get read text fairly obvious advocate near level thing confucianism real spiritual/ metaphysical insinuation learn interaction observation daoist value nature find social role instituionlization restrictive non valuable spontaneous change cretae metaphysical perspectivism action inaction anti authoritarian anti political importantly daoism dao function fundamental principle work like flux greek fundamental judgement dao amoral spontaneous nature right wrong good bad virtue daoism paradoxical extremely complicated implication thing close daoism buddhism hinduism daoism preache let distinction sage truly completely aware confucian society social heirachy harmonious society value compassion ritual concept virtuous person completely arbitrary distinction manipulation benevolent religion pro government pro society control fundamentally confucian believe heaven ordain way human exist reality inherently ethcial good bad right wrong virtue confucianism hardly implication point see display thousand time different culture confucianism preache observe manipulate distinction virtuous control chathoclic protestant argue non implicative theory discuss ancient philosopher differ church structure think pray importance baptism communion importantly adherence pope thing actually different load ton mysticism ritual philosophical nature majority time modern philosopher like 1600s-1800 bunch people argue rational christianity try validate differentiate sect descarte start party rest follow distinction human psychology metaphysical argument pretty moot simple leibiniz basis calculus conceptualization moand important people like berekly immaterialism beat death point hume notabley drop bomb shell human psychology give psychological framework development belief pretty obvious point ancient greek discuss,-1,,,0.9188,,,positive

The Tao that can be described is not the Eternal Tao. The Tao Te Ching is an attempt to describe the Tao. It admits in itself that it is not exhaustive and cannot be perfect in its description.

We went through all six seasons in like 3 weeks. So, that really resonated. Of course,  now I've (she's gone now) been through countless series over the last few years. 

So, what does it mean to be a latter day Daoist ... how do you go about it? As you point out, there is no one size fits all ... or even many. We are all unique as individuals. Everyone has to find there own formula.

Under the heading of things to consider that I found helpful:

First of all, I had to set aside the notion of religion. Decided that substituting one religion for another was probably not going to be very helpful. By religion, I mean aset of prescribed ritualistic practices largely taken on faith. Seems like that is following someone else's sense of practice. I'm not saying put away religion forever. Just set it aside and don't try to mix it Daoism.

Then, I found physical practice to be important. Daoism isn't just a head thing. The idea being that the practice of Daoism, whatever that was going to mean for me, had to be approached holistically. So, I returned to martial arts. I found a teacher that also taught the philosophy behind the I Ching as related to martial arts. This eventually led to Taijiquan and other forms of Qigong. This helped immensely with meditation. 

If I had to pick one important lesson above all others, it would be learning how not to have to respond to what ... or who ... you encounter. This came out of meditation somewhat, in the sense that meditation can help you to understand that you see more clearly when the mind is quiet. So, I began by resisting the urge to have to interject a point of view in certain settings. Turned out this was extremely helpful when dealing in team settings, where everybody is trying to out-do everyone else. Allowed me to get the broader perspective on where the team was at before offering input.

1kd6kdc,mqb0pei,t3_1kd6kdc,Delicious_Block_9253,"Okay, I don’t want to get too into it because there’s a lot of complex history here. But I am going to summarize three narratives. One is the mythical origin of the trigrams and the hexagrams. One is how that’s an allegory for the origin of the universe itself and the processes of change in the universe. And one is modern scholars’ best guess at a historical interpretation of all of this.

If you want to learn about all three of those stories in a lot more detail, then I highly recommend Benebell Wen’s YouTube channel. She has a video on the eight trigrams specifically, as well as the four images, yin and yang, the 64 hexagrams, etc.

So, starting with the mythical origins: There was a cultural hero called Fuxi. He observed nature and came up with the eight trigrams. The order of the eight trigrams was revealed to him when a mythical horse, sent down from divinity, showed him the He Tu, or the Yellow River Map, on its back, which organizes the numbers 1-10 and has lots of numerological and symbolic significance.

Later, during the reign of Emperor Yao, a mythical emperor, Dayu helped control apocalyptic-level floods. The Luo Shu—a three-by-three square of the numbers one through nine—was revealed to him on the back of a turtle. This also has lots of numerological significance. This is a bit of a simplification, but the He Tu describes the innate flow of nature and the Luo Shu helps us understand how to intervene in processes of change. Using all of that information, he was able to design a system of canals to help control the great floods.

Then, King Wen used the Luo Shu to come up with a new order of the trigrams (later-heaven arrangement) and combined those two orderings of the eight trigrams. Using numerological information from both the He Tu and the Luo Shu, he came up with the 64 hexagrams. The Duke of Zhou added a set of commentaries. Later—at least in the traditional telling—Confucius (or more likely, his followers) added even more commentary. That’s how we got the I Ching.

Now, in terms of the symbolic meaning of all of this: there was the great numinous void—or the Tao, or God, or whatever you want to call it. This concept of perfect undifferentiatedness gave rise to qi which gave rise to yin and yang. Yang is a full line; yin is a broken line.

You can combine these into pairs of lines, each of which represents either the culmination of one energy that is beginning to reverse into its opposite, or a transitional phase between yin and yang. These also represent the four faces of the Dao. Then, by adding a yin or yang line to each of those four combinations, you get the eight trigrams that Fuxi came up with.

These are representative of eight forces or energies in nature that can help us understand the various forms that situations can take. Then, when you pair each trigram with every other trigram—including itself—you get a total of 64 hexagrams: a symbolic map of all the possible ways that change can take place in the world and the universe. The five phases of change (wuxing) explain 5 elemental forces that can cause things to change.

This symbolic story is often how chapter 42 from the Dao De Jing is read:

Tao engenders One, One engenders Two, Two engenders Three, Three engenders the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry shade And embrace sunlight. Shade and sunlight, yin and yang, Breath blending into harmony.
(Addis and Lombardo Translation)

or
Way-making (dao) gives rise to continuity, Continuity gives rise to difference, Difference gives rise to plurality, And plurality gives rise to the manifold of everything that is happening (wanwu). Everything carries yin on its shoulders and yang in its arms And blends these vital energies (qi) together to make them harmonious (he).
(Hall and Ames Translation)

Our best guess from a modern historical perspective is that all of this originated from early Chinese folk religion and proto-Daoist practices. In particular, it was probably developed by ritual specialists—often called shamans, though that term is problematic—who used oracle bones and other divination methods to advise rulers and interpret the forces of nature.

Now it’s time for me to editorialize a bit. I believe this incredibly complex symbolic and numerological system arose naturally during a period in Chinese history marked by close ties to nature (giving insight from the more-than-human world), widespread mystical‑shamanic practices (giving spiritual insight), and the birth of the Chinese writing system. Those forces converged to produce a great body of wisdom, and writing ensured its preservation.

That wisdom emphasizes a philosophy of becoming—how things change and morph—far more than a philosophy of being, which classifies and separates. This focus is invaluable, because most modern philosophy, especially in the West, concentrates on being rather than becoming.

Seen this way, the layers of symbols (qi, yin/yang, the trigrams, etc.) - and the I Ching, Tao Te Ching, Zhuangzi, and other Daoist texts - are portals into a culture (or at least subgroups like oracle bone diviners within that culture) that understood how change works with remarkable depth. Of course, the ancient Chinese were not alone; similar insights appear in Aztec and Maya cosmology, Yoruba divination, and many other traditions.

When people hang the Bagua and speak of its power, I see several layers at work. First are the cultural heroes and myths: if divinity revealed the He Tu and Luo Shu on the backs of magical creatures, and if those diagrams guided a sage in crafting the eight trigrams, the symbols are naturally auspicious. Even without that mythic layer, the Bagua embodies the accumulated spiritual, religious, and philosophical insights of countless people over millennia—and that, in itself, is powerful. And, in both interpretations, the way that these symbols represent the very fabric of reality itself carries power.

Sidenote: If anybody reading this is at all interested in Western philosophy as well and wants to learn more about the handful of western philosophers throughout history that has emphasized becoming and not being, I recommend checking out Heraclitus, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Deleuze!",12,1746238010.0,0,okay want lot complex history go summarize narrative mythical origin trigram hexagram allegory origin universe process change universe modern scholar good guess historical interpretation want learn story lot detail highly recommend benebell wen youtube channel video trigram specifically image yin yang hexagrams etc start mythical origin cultural hero call fuxi observe nature come trigram order trigram reveal mythical horse send divinity show yellow river map organize number lot numerological symbolic significance later reign emperor yao mythical emperor dayu help control apocalyptic level flood luo shu square number reveal turtle lot numerological significance bit simplification describe innate flow nature luo shu help understand intervene process change information able design system canal help control great flood king wen luo shu come new order trigram later heaven arrangement combine ordering trigram numerological information luo shu come hexagram duke zhou add set commentary later traditional telling confucius likely follower add commentary get che term symbolic meaning great numinous void tao god want concept perfect undifferentiatedness give rise give rise yin yang yang line yin broken line combine pair line represent culmination energy begin reverse opposite transitional phase yin yang represent face dao add yin yang line combination trigram fuxi come representative force energy nature help understand form situation pair trigram trigram include total hexagram symbolic map possible way change place world universe phase change wuxing explain elemental force cause thing change symbolic story chapter dao jing read tao engender engender engender engender thousand thing thousand thing carry shade embrace sunlight shade sunlight yin yang breath blend harmony addis lombardo translation way making dao give rise continuity continuity give rise difference difference give rise plurality plurality give rise manifold happen wanwu carry yin shoulder yang arm blend vital energy harmonious hall ame translation good guess modern historical perspective originate early chinese folk religion proto daoist practice particular probably develop ritual specialist call shamans term problematic oracle bone divination method advise ruler interpret force nature time editorialize bit believe incredibly complex symbolic numerological system arise naturally period chinese history mark close tie nature give insight human world widespread mystical‑shamanic practice give spiritual insight birth chinese writing system force converge produce great body wisdom writing ensure preservation wisdom emphasize philosophy thing change morph far philosophy classify separate focus invaluable modern philosophy especially west concentrate see way layer symbol yin yang trigram etc ching tao ching zhuangzi daoist text portal culture subgroup like oracle bone diviner culture understand change work remarkable depth course ancient chinese similar insight appear aztec maya cosmology yoruba divination tradition people hang bagua speak power layer work cultural hero myth divinity reveal luo shu back magical creature diagram guide sage craft trigram symbol naturally auspicious mythic layer bagua embody accumulate spiritual religious philosophical insight countless people millennia powerful interpretation way symbol represent fabric reality carry power sidenote anybody read interested western philosophy want learn handful western philosopher history emphasize recommend check heraclitus nietzsche heidegger deleuze,5,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,Philosophical Exploration,0.9993,,,positive

The DDJ talks about the valley in the valley, with the language being about the mother, or as Wang Bi puts it, the dark mother, that gives life and nourishes. This dark mother is as opposed to the lord of heaven, which is a masculine figure. Ultimately, the power of the DDJ is the choice to ""remember your mother"" and to reject mere imitation of the father. Remembering the mother means understanding that contrary positions have a similar origin, and politically this would sit well with a philosophy of ""put aside our differences for now..."". 

You're worried about your political movement being demotivated by impotence. The lesson of remembering the dark mother, is that all power comes from this valley in the valley - and remembering that is open to everyone. It is only possible to be impotent by caring for things other than the dao, or in this example, by forgetting the mother. 

Suppose your political group really wanted to stop a racist cafe in your local town. But you've tried talking to people and picketing, but their coffee is just so damn tasty and cheap that you can't convince anyone. To remember the mother would be to see the racist owner's views and your anti-racist views both have the same origin, and the source of power of each is in how you set aside the stringent holding on. In the cafe example, it's likely that the racism doesn't come in at all to their coffee making mastery - that power of good coffee is granted by the dark mother because they do not hold a dogma about it. So, you could set aside those differences and outcompete them with your own coffee that's better and cheaper (or the same without the racism), or on a deeper level, you could think about the need for belonging and desire for freedom and power that underlies both your anti-racist and their racist beliefs, and speak from your heart to the owner to change their heart.

And discussing this creates a 'what came first? The egg or chicken?' dilemma.

Because men created a 'male' imperative on power dynamics and certain actions.

1kd6ia0,mq98562,t1_mq8lr7d,Delicious_Block_9253,"Most Daoists historically have considered all of the Daoist metaphysics and numerology to have been, at least partly some sort of divine revelation. This includes yin and yang, the yellow river map, the luotu magic square, elder and younger yin and yang, the eight trigrams, and the 64 hexagrams, as well as the five phases of change, although some of these have some degree of human derivation from cosmological principles or divine revelation. All of this is a formal system of analyzing how a great unity (the Dao, the numinous void,taiji) can produce duality: yin/yang, how change happens (the five phases of change in the 64 hexagrams), etc.

On the other hand, some commentators certainly have made the point that using knowledge of these things to interfere in the process of change may bring about various versions of what Daoists conceive of as the apocalypse sooner. 

All of this is to say that @psychobudist's point about the complexities of yin/yang is very valid, and well supported by what is pretty much consensus Daoist belief throughout history. At the same time, @Spiritual_List_979's point about interfering in the grand plan is a valid one - there's not consensus there. There is a belief (more info below) that using the luotu magic square (which was part of the derivation of the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching) brings on the apocalypse sooner. That being said, that's a slightly more fringe doctrine, many would say it is impossible to truly oppose or interfere with the Dao, since it's all encompassing, and any perceived transgression is a result of our limited human perspective. This same point is seen in many other traditions as well.

Here's some info about the apocalypse thing I mentioned, from Benebell Wen. Important context is that the two maps together are how we get the I Ching, a text you can use for divination in Daoist folk practices.
""The He Tu acknowledges an order to nature's chaotic madness. It's the natural flow of rivers and the movements of the stars above us.
Meanwhile the Lo Shu is like you dividing up and grouping in categories all the stuff in your space and creating organization out of that chaotic madness...
The He Tu River Map, and by river we also mean the Milky Way, because these maps are maps of constellations as much as they are maps of land formations, is the computed simulation of how energy flows in the universe. These are laws. This is the automatic operating system of Nature.
The Lo Shu River Map is a computing system for calculating how to harness and control the way energy flows in the universe. These are formulas. This is machinery. Intelligence.
A manual operating system for exerting your Willpower. This is how you nurture that which was presented as nature.
Taoist occult practitioners read deeply into these glyph formations. Feng shui calculations are heavily reliant on these pathways, as are hand mudras and pacing rituals. **There's also an esoteric doctrine holding that the He Tu is a diagram of Creation and the Lo Shu is not only technology and advancement, but a prophetic, apocalyptic vision of our Destruction.
There's a fascinating yet uncomfortable contradiction here. The occultist must use the Lo Shu to create Change. But the more the technology of the Lo Shu is utilized to change this universe, the closer we are to destroying our universe. In a sense, we are materializing an apocalyptic vision.**"" [Source.](https://benebellwen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-ching-the-oracle-companion-course-lectures-all-transcripts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

1kd6ia0,mqbhtlk,t1_mqbbu70,Delicious_Block_9253,"There are probably around 170 million people in China that have some sort of religious/spiritual connection with Daoist practices and beliefs. The vast majority know about and implement the very basics of Daoist metaphysics, including qi, yin/yang, sixiang, bagua, and the I Ching 64 hexagrams. This is why you'll see the taijitu (yin/yang symbol) surrounding by the trigrams and/or hexagrams all over the place in Daoist temples. I don't think it's fair to trivialize these beliefs and practices as trying and failing to interpret yin and yang. I know for sure it's not fair to inaccurately claim that these things are ""now rejected by Taoism."" Sure, this sub and most Western Daoists (not assuming you are from the West or anything else about your background) don't talk much about these concepts, but regardless you're in the minority of Daoists globally that don't implement these beliefs.

It's okay if there's a part of a tradition you don't know about or agree with or implement yourself, but please don't speak for hundreds of millions of others.

“The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.”

You absolutely can walk the Tao while being a materialist or agnostic. The Tao itself doesn’t demand belief >> it invites alignment. Laozi and Zhuangzi weren’t giving us metaphysics to memorize. They were offering lenses to *see more clearly*, *resist less*, and *live more freely*.

It’s true that later forms of Taoism layered in ritual, cosmology, and alchemical traditions, some deeply symbolic, some more literal. Whether you see internal alchemy as energetic transformation or as a poetic way to explore the self, both can serve the same function: creating harmony between your body, mind, and life’s flow.

My take would be something like:  
**You don’t need to** ***believe*** **in the system to benefit from the alignment it offers.**  
Practice what resonates, let go of what doesn’t. The Tao isn’t about conformity. It’s about congruence.

So yes, you can practice deeply - even transform - without needing a spiritual ontology.

Guo Xiang, who edited the version of The Zhuangzi that we have today from 52 chapters down to 33 chapters, took a staunchly anti-metaphysical and atheistic position. Historically, his commentary has been the most influential, so clearly there were Daoists of the Xuanxue 玄學 (NeoDaoism) school of thought who rejected a metaphysical Dao. Here is an excerpt from Brook Ziporyn regarding Guo Xiang's anti-metaphysical stance. There are also other books available on this subject matter:-

>**GUO XIANG (252–312). Responsible for editing the original fifty-five chapter version of the Zhuangzi down to the current thirty-three chapter version, Guo Xiang is also the most influential of all its commentators, his work later being treated as the de facto “official” commentary when the text came to be recognized as canonical in imperial collections. His commentary is based closely on Xiang Xiu’s lost work, to the point of raising suspicions of plagiarism. All later commentators may be assumed to have studied Guo’s commentary closely. Guo’s staunchly anti-metaphysical, anti-foundationalist, and anti-theistic interpretation of Zhuangzi rejects any notion of the Course as creator or source of beings, and with it any ontological hierarchy between Heaven and Man or between the Course and things. Instead, he stresses the concept of spontaneity, or “self-so,” (ziran, ) reading Zhuangzi’s Course as literally nonbeing, so that claims of the Course’s creation of things are to be understood as meaning that nothing interferes with the self-so self-creation, and also intrinsic rightness, of each individual thing. “Self-so” is the antonym of deliberate activity and of the purposive knowledge that goes with it. All deliberate activity, in Guo’s view, is based on the “traces” left by one particular self-so event on another, which come to inspire conscious esteem and emulation, thereby interfering with the self-so process that functions in the absence of cognitions, ideals, explicit values, and deliberate endeavors. Guo often interprets against the grain of the surface meaning of the Zhuangzi text, particularly when it is satirical or critical of Confucian sages or when it seems to advocate withdrawal from active involvement in the world of affairs. For Guo, the critiques in the text are merely of the sages’ “traces,” not of the sages themselves, who were themselves perfectly merged into their own self-so and thus perfectly right in all their deeds, but who thereby unfortunately, through no fault of their own, came to be valued and emulated by later people, thereby undermining and disturbing the self-so rightness of these misguided admirers.

The DDJ differs in that the responsibility ultimately rests on the ruler to do good, rather than ministers or individuals. In that way it's an inversion of Legalism that talks of holding individuals and families responsible. The other way DDJ differs is the abandonment of rule of law or similar, where individual tactics or interpretations of law hold weight.

A lot of people remember the use of strict punishment from legalism, and the DDJ addresses this by arguing the absence of punishment is the real goal, where punishment and reward should be come as a surprise from a ruler.

The DDJ is for the most part a response to Confucian ideas and ideas similar to legalism, but while Confucianism at the time can't really sustain a strict heriachy and absolute power in a monarch like legalism, the DDJ argues this is required.

But the hours of a fixed time do not accord with nature any longer. 

Zi and Wu are energies in relation to true local midnight and noon. 

Mao and You are energies in relation to sunrise and sunset.

It is better that these days time zone nuances are taken into account. But what happens when people get into arranged marriages based on compatibilities that are reflected in incorrect timing systems, as has happened in China for many hundreds of years? Humanity becomes estranged from nature. 

Hexagram 30 line 5 relates to the outer clarity that needs to recognize and regret its own presuming to know, so that it may ever remain humble and tethered to true inner clarity. 

I did some work with He Luo Li Shu, and found that it was very accurate - when the timing of the BaZi system it is based upon was rectified.

1kc2xvk,mq1ae7o,t1_mq0nn51,boy_in_black_1412,"In English, there isn’t words to explain this graph. But i will try my best:

As you know, there only one “Ki” or “Qi”, an basic elementary of the universe. 

When this Ki expands, it become sky, masculine, light …. Or Yang: — (a solid line)

When this Ki contracting, it become earth, feminism, dark…. Or Yin: - - (a broken line)

When Yin and Yang reacting, it become The Four Great Symbols:
 
* Greater Yang (太陽 - Tài Yáng): Represented by a solid line over a solid line (⚌). It signifies dominant Yang.
 * Lesser Yin (少陰 - Shào Yīn): Represented by a solid line over a broken line (⚎). It signifies Yang with a touch of Yin emerging.
 * Lesser Yang (少陽 - Shào Yáng): Represented by a broken line over a solid line (⚍). It signifies Yin with a touch of Yang emerging.
 * Greater Yin (太陰 - Tài Yīn): Represented by a broken line over a broken line (⚏). It signifies dominant Yin.

Next, The Eight Trigrams as you see on a normal (Bagua) are formed by adding one more line (either a solid Yang line or a broken Yin line) to each of the Four Symbols. This creates eight unique combinations of three lines.

Here are the names and common representations of the Eight Trigrams, showing how they are derived from the Four Symbols:
 * Heaven / Sky (乾 - Qián): Formed by adding a Yang line to Greater Yang (⚌ + —) resulting in ☰
 * Lake / Marsh (兌 - Duì): Formed by adding a Yin line to Greater Yang (⚌ + --) resulting in ☱
 * Fire (離 - Lí): Formed by adding a Yang line to Lesser Yang (⚍ + —) resulting in ☲
 * Thunder (震 - Zhèn): Formed by adding a Yin line to Lesser Yang (⚍ + --) resulting in ☳
 * Wind / Wood (巽 - Xùn): Formed by adding a Yang line to Lesser Yin (⚎ + —) resulting in ☴
 * Water (坎 - Kǎn): Formed by adding a Yin line to Lesser Yin (⚎ + --) resulting in ☵
 * Mountain (艮 - Gèn): Formed by adding a Yang line to Greater Yin (⚏ + —) resulting in ☶
 * Earth (坤 - Kūn): Formed by adding a Yin line to Greater Yin (⚏ + --) resulting in ☷

The Eight Trigrams (Bagua) are indeed arranged in two primary sequences: 

1. the Primordial Bagua (先天八卦 - Xiāntiān Bāguà), also known as the Earlier Heaven Bagua or Fuxi Bagua. (Row 2,3)

_Order (row 3) (common representation, starting from Qian/Heaven at the top and moving clockwise):
   * Heaven (☰ - Qián)
   * Lake (☱ - Duì)
   * Fire (☲ - Lí)
   * Thunder (☳ - Zhèn)

Opposite counters clockwise, up to down.
   * Wind (☴ - Xùn)
   * Water (☵ - Kǎn)
   * Mountain (☶ - Gèn)
   * Earth (☷ - Kūn)

2. the Manifested Bagua (後天八卦 - Hòutiān Bāguà), also known as the Later Heaven Bagua or King Wen Bagua. (Row4,5)

_Order (row5) (common representation, often placed on a square with Li/Fire at the top clockwise, but when counting, start with Thunder):
   * Fire (☲ - Lí) (South)
   * Earth (☷ - Kūn) (Southwest)
   * Lake (☱ - Duì) (West)
   * Heaven (☰ - Qián) (Northwest)
   * Water (☵ - Kǎn) (North)
   * Mountain (☶ - Gèn) (Northeast)
   * Thunder (☳ - Zhèn) (East)
   * Wind (☴ - Xùn) (Southeast)

These two arrangements reflect different cosmological understandings.

1kca1br,mq17uyn,t3_1kca1br,P_S_Lumapac,"Just on the idea that a practitioner would give a better translation, that is almost certainly not the case. It's important to know the original texts are not written in contemporary Chinese, and the leading translators are not Chinese (there are lots of good Chinese translators, but they're not the best in the field - that is changing though as China improves its scholarship).

For those examples, you'll find translators from thousands of years ago having similar variations. The original texts varied between copies and the style was what we might call poetic. If the thrust is similar it's fine. The more interesting differences between translations might be called sweeping.

But I understand just wanting a straight forward non academic reading that doesn't give detailed caveats to each line. Would be nice, but the issue is people who are in the market for that are also in the market for super natural or mystical readings of the texts that simply aren't accurate - they basically inventions of the authors. That's fine, but I'd just say if what you want is some temples teachings, just go to that temple and ask for their teachings. You'll be disappointed if you expect their teachings to line up with a decent translation of the original texts.

just to illustrate the ""it's not Chinese"" point, here's some English (start of Beowulf) from a much smaller time gap (about 1000 vs 2500):

1kca1br,mq2pg1r,t3_1kca1br,Delicious_Block_9253,"TLDR: Multiple possible meanings are definitely part of translation studies, and likely intentionally baked into the text itself. If you don't want to think about differing interpretations, just ignore those footnotes in whatever translation you pick. Personally, I ended up choosing Ziporyn as my main reference, but the ones you and other commenters mentioned are all good.

See my comment on u/P_S_Lumapac's post for some points on Native Chinese vs. English speakers, but a bit more pragmatically, it is fair to prioritize different goals when picking a translator.

A Taoist practitioner may be able to better represent modern, on-the-ground interpretations of the text and connect it with Daoist practices and the living tradition. An English-speaking scholar with lots of experience translating Classical Chinese texts, due to the first/second language issue in my other comment may be able to produce a very high-quality translation from a linguistic/text fidelity perspective, especially in terms of rendering meaning/nuance into English. A Chinese scholar whose primary work is the exegesis of Daoist texts might produce a translation that best represents how modern Chinese scholars interpret the text (this will probably align well with things like Chinese academic philosophy, but maybe not so well modern Daoism as a living tradition, like you'd find in a temple). All of these are ""as close as possible to the original Chinese"" in different ways.

Unfortunately, all of this means that there are a broad range of high-quality ways to translate any ancient text, and differences in the goal of translation, who is doing the translation, the audience, etc. can produce somewhat or even wildly different translated texts. It's definitely not a situation where where we can avoid ""multiple \[valid\] meanings for something,"" but then again embracing this ambiguity of language and interpretation is a fundamental part of Daoist thought - as seen in the first line of the DDJ and various parts of the Zhuangzi. This is especially true for texts of the Daoist canon, which have intentional layers of ambiguity, double meaning, and esotericism (in my opinion, although not everyone's).

In general, it sounds like your goal is more about understanding the ideas expressed in the Zhuangzi than diving into debates about philology yourself. In that case, I'd say any of the major translations mentioned in your post or other comments are a valid place to start, each with different pros/cons for someone more interested in practice than scholarship. If you want to avoid commentary on multiple possible meanings of words, trust that whatever the translator put in the main text of their translation is going to be what they think is the best of multiple possible translations. Know that there are going to be hundreds of differences between translations just like trash/blade of grass/mustard seed, and these differing choices tend to be pretty valid! Trust that trash/blade of grass/mustard seed are probably all pretty good ways to get most of the underlying meaning across, but none are perfect. Exceptions are works that have a reputation for dishonesty/inaccurate representation (e.g. Mitchell's DDJ).

Most translators, to some degree or another, discuss these ambiguities at some point in their translation/preface/footnotes/etc. If you don't want to plod through those ambiguities, then just ignore those parts!

All of that being said, I have found that leaning into the philological/exegetical debates and ambiguity here has been an important part of developing my own understanding/practice! All of these problems with interpreting and translating these texts are results of the problems with language itself, a common theme in Daoist thought!",2,1746128982.0,0,tldr multiple possible meaning definitely translation study likely intentionally bake text want think differ interpretation ignore footnote translation pick personally end choose ziporyn main reference one commenter mention good comment p_s_lumapac post point native chinese vs. english speaker bit pragmatically fair prioritize different goal pick translator taoist practitioner able well represent modern ground interpretation text connect daoist practice living tradition english speak scholar lot experience translate classical chinese text second language issue comment able produce high quality translation linguistic text fidelity perspective especially term render meaning nuance english chinese scholar primary work exegesis daoist text produce translation well represent modern chinese scholar interpret text probably align thing like chinese academic philosophy maybe modern daoism living tradition like find temple close possible original chinese different way unfortunately mean broad range high quality way translate ancient text difference goal translation translation audience etc produce somewhat wildly different translate text definitely situation avoid multiple \[valid\ meaning embrace ambiguity language interpretation fundamental daoist thought see line ddj part zhuangzi especially true text daoist canon intentional layer ambiguity double meaning esotericism opinion general sound like goal understand idea express zhuangzi dive debate philology case major translation mention post comment valid place start different pro con interested practice scholarship want avoid commentary multiple possible meaning word trust translator main text translation go think good multiple possible translation know go hundred difference translation like trash blade grass mustard seed differ choice tend pretty valid trust trash blade grass mustard seed probably pretty good way underlying meaning perfect exception work reputation dishonesty inaccurate representation e.g. mitchell ddj translator degree discuss ambiguity point translation preface footnote etc want plod ambiguity ignore part say find lean philological exegetical debate ambiguity important develop understanding practice problem interpret translate text result problem language common theme daoist thought,1,Translation Quality and Fidelity in Taoism Texts,Philosophical Exploration,0.9959,,,positive

>""Moreover, if an accumulation of water is not ample enough, it won’t have the strength to support a big boat. Upset a cup of water onto a dip in the hall floor, and a mustard seed can serve as a boat on it, but if you place a cup there, it will get stuck, for the water will prove too shallow and the boat too big. All this clarifies how the Peng flies high because of the huge size of its wings. Now, what the small in mass have to rely on need not be great, and what the great in mass have to use need not be small. Therefore, as principles \[li\] define the absolute capacity \[zhifen\] of things, so things have fixed limits \[dingji\], but each thing’s capacity is sufficient for it to behave as it should; thus the way things operate is the same for all. However, when a thing fails to keep control over forgetting life and instead belabors life beyond limits appropriate to it, then its behavior won’t suit its potential and its actions won’t accord with its innate tendencies \[qing\].When this happens, even wings so big they hang down from the sky will fail to avoid exhaustion, and flyers that suddenly burst upward will fail to avoid coming to grief.

>**Guo Xiang commentary**:- The reason that “only then does it take aim at the South” is not because it is fond of great heights and longs for distant places but because, as long as the wind had not accumulated amply enough beneath, the way forward had remained blocked.

1kca1br,mq2jgfj,t1_mq17uyn,Delicious_Block_9253,"Just to expand on your point about first language Chinese vs. English speaking translators:

The field of translation, for a long time, has considered it better for the translator to be translating *into*, **not** *from* their first language (at least in Western Europe and the Americas). This is often called the ""Native Language Principle."" Various professional organizations, and even the UN have clear guidelines on this. In the past few decades, there's more of a recognition of how a diverse **team** of people from various backgrounds tend to produce even better translations. Of course, this is complicated by the point you make about the difference between modern Chinese and that of the Zhuangzi, as well as the fact that this principle is not commonly accepted everywhere in the world. This can be especially true when you're looking for a translation that represents overall conceptual meaning well - it's easier to interpret nuance in your second language (armed with dictionaries and commentaries) and represent it in your first language, than interpret it in your first (very easy, often automatic) and represent it in your second language (very difficult - easy to write phrases that would be ambiguous, interpreted in a different way, etc.). All of this is why for high-profile realtime meetings (e.g. the UN), there will be one interpreter for each language, each interpreting into, and not from their first language.

All of that is to say that the reason the best translations often have English as their first language is not necessarily a lack of high-quality Chinese scholarship/exegesis on texts like the Zhuangzi but rather the way the brain processes your first vs. your second language and the inherent limitations of second-language proficiency.

Good article that dives deep into this: [https://cbltranslations.com/blog/legal-translators-native-language/?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://cbltranslations.com/blog/legal-translators-native-language/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",3,1746127256.0,1,expand point language chinese vs. english speaking translator field translation long time consider well translator translate language western europe america call native language principle professional organization clear guideline past decade recognition diverse team people background tend produce well translation course complicate point difference modern chinese zhuangzi fact principle commonly accept world especially true look translation represent overall conceptual meaning easy interpret nuance second language arm dictionary commentary represent language interpret easy automatic represent second language difficult easy write phrase ambiguous interpret different way etc high profile realtime meeting e.g. interpreter language interpreting language reason good translation english language necessarily lack high quality chinese scholarship exegesis text like zhuangzi way brain process vs. second language inherent limitation second language proficiency good article dive deep,1,Translation Quality and Fidelity in Taoism Texts,Philosophical Exploration,0.9594,NEUTRAL,0.577706515789032,trust

It's not what we do, or think, per se, it's our attitude about what we do. 

Nei Yeh Chapter 3 states:

""All the forms of the mind are naturally infused and filled with it [the vital essence], are naturally generated and developed [because of] it.

It is lost inevitably because of sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire, and profit-seeking.

If you are able to cast off sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desire and profit-seeking, your mind will just revert to equanimity.

We impose emotional imperatives upon the outcomes we pursue and this is what causes our discontent. 

When we emotionally ""need"" an outcome, and get it, we are pleased/happy, when don't get it, we are displeased/unhappy. 

When we cease emotional attachments/impositions to outcomes of our actions we have wishes, goals, and purposes without the attending displeasure when our chosen outcome doesn't occur in the manner we had wished.

We could take our desires and push, and shove, and fight.  We could impose our desire on the world.  But when you push on the Tao, the Tao pushes back.  Not because the Tao fights you, but simply because the Tao will not be pushed on.  To say this other ways, the universe always has equal and opposite reactions.  That which swings one way must swing back.  Etc.  if you push, there is always some way that something will push right back.

Who are you? Really?

Are you your ego self? Or is there something deeper to who you are? 

What if you had not been conditioned in the ways of humanity, ever? 

But born to flow with nature? 

There are needs, and there are desires. Desires are not needs. 

Surrendering to the flow of present moment. Looking for food when hungry, eating, then moving on.

I think it's a good observation that much of the world operates without resistance. Do you mean you're close to 100% wuwei in that you're physically near to things that are 100% wuwei? Title makes it sound like you're 99% there but then the text makes it sound like you're nowhere near it (which is fine, it takes time).

There's some buddhists in the comments. Would be nice if they started ""as someone who is buddhist and not daoist ... ""

As a general point, wu wei work is still work. No one is claiming the work will be enjoyable or painless.  That would be delusional, or maybe you have some really good painkillers. Wu wei is always described as opposed to taking a resistant path, where resistance is caused by dogmatic or intuitive thinking that imposes an concrete idea on the world, as opposed to flexibility in thinking/action that doesn't impose ideas but reacts. The resistance is not physical effort - you could lead quite a pleasant and effort free life without ever getting close to wu wei (imagine cocktails by the pool). If you do laundry with wu wei, it would be like those tiktoks where the guys fold a fitted sheet in like 3 movements. It would be about getting really really good at doing laundry. Unless you work at a dry cleaners, I would be surprised if this actually was your goal. The resistance would be all your ideas about laundry that when applied to fitted sheets, leave you with a mess. 

A good example of wu wei is when learning to draw, an artist has to go through a phase of removing the idea of marking down symbols for objects, rather than plotting out how the object appears to the eye.

1kb4j5e,mrdq9in,t3_1kb4j5e,SeekerofDao1,"This is my understanding 

Wu wei doesn't mean ""no motion"" or ""no exertion."" It means no forcing. It’s when your actions arise so naturally from your being—your alignment with the moment—that they cost you no inner resistance. The river flows downhill, and though it's in motion, it's not struggling. The same river could carve mountains, yet it never strains.

The key is whether you are pushing against yourself or acting from yourself. When the mind is in conflict, when we “try” to do something because we must, we feel drained.

In short wu wei it’s not about zero effort—it’s about the absence of strain. It's the doing that doesn’t come from pushing.

Let's say in a more simpler term for example

Just like we walk—naturally, without needing to think—so too does the body move in instinct. If I accidentally place my finger on a hot pan, I pull it away instantly. Not because I think to do it, but because the body knows. It acts without thought. That is reflex. That is instinct.

If I were to wait—if I paused to let the mind understand what happened, then decide what to do—it would already be too late. The burn would deepen. The pain would linger. Damage would take root. But because the body moves before the mind interferes, I am protected.

This is wu wei.

It is action without force, movement without mental strain. It is the way of nature within us, doing what must be done without hesitation.

1kbc1bp,mptglhk,t3_1kbc1bp,P_S_Lumapac,"In DDJ, Heaven and Earth are paired up, where basically earth means where people live and heaven is where spirits and specific natural laws live. This is just Chinese cosmology at the time, and I don't think they were trying to more specific than that. Maybe they believed more, maybe less - it wasn't the focus of the texts.

The only spirits mentioned are the Lord of heaven, who sits atop heaven is the analogy to the ruler, and sits like a father figure to the other analogy of dark mother who resides under Earth. These are likely not literal as they are limited to these functions and not personified. Similar to ""mother of invention"". The Yin Yang stuff is not related beyond these analogies - Laozi did not care about Yin Yang stuff. Without much controversy Wang Bi translated the Yin Yang passage to be about hens and roosters - it really wasn't an important line.

As I said, these aren't really important. For this general Daoism what's important is that there is something higher that allows this set up of heaven and earth. This is called Dao in the broad sense that Chinese thought generally uses it. (the DDJ goes further to talk of the higher Dao, and relates this to heaven but that's separate. That's what the DDJ is about, and it's implication for ethics too).

I think it's interesting that many Daoist religions today do concern themselves with the cosmology and many people attracted to the original texts also want to know about supernatural levels of existence. This really couldn't be further from the original texts, that simply didn't make any claims about these. Confucius was the other big school at the time, and also didn't think much of these ideas. That era of philosophy is largely marked by humanism, even the competing legalism really didn't care for this talk.

You might be interested in asking specifically ""in your Daoist temple, what do your teachers believe about heaven?"" because the more broad question of daoism will refer to the DDJ and Zhuangzi which don't really talk about supernatural stuff. You could argue the DDJ's metaphysics is supernatural, but it's not personified or somewhere life is, so I don't think it's what's meant.

In terms of tracing where the supernatural bent comes into Chinese thought, maybe 600 years or so after Daoism, Buddhism showed up, with the joke ""first they had to teach the Chinese they had souls before teaching them they didn't"" because Chinese thought for the most part was dominated by humanist ideas not supernatural ones. (The irony here is there has never been a religion that more strongly believes in and obsesses over eternal souls than Buddhism, while the early teachings were radically humanist. About 15 years ago Zen decided it would stop believing in eternal souls, but one wonders in what way it remains Buddhist given it now looks nothing like any other Buddhists. Most Zen Buddhists still believe in eternal souls.)",5,1746009997.0,0,ddj heaven earth pair basically earth mean people live heaven spirit specific natural law live chinese cosmology time think try specific maybe believe maybe focus text spirit mention lord heaven sit atop heaven analogy ruler sit like father figure analogy dark mother reside earth likely literal limit function personify similar mother invention yin yang stuff relate analogy laozi care yin yang stuff controversy wang translate yin yang passage hen rooster important line say important general daoism important high allow set heaven earth call dao broad sense chinese think generally use ddj go talk high dao relate heaven separate ddj implication ethic think interesting daoist religion today concern cosmology people attract original text want know supernatural level existence original text simply claim confucius big school time think idea era philosophy largely mark humanism compete legalism care talk interested ask specifically daoist temple teacher believe heaven broad question daoism refer ddj zhuangzi talk supernatural stuff argue ddj metaphysics supernatural personify life think mean term trace supernatural bent come chinese thought maybe 600 year daoism buddhism show joke teach chinese soul teach chinese think dominate humanist idea supernatural one irony religion strongly believe obsesse eternal soul buddhism early teaching radically humanist year ago zen decide stop believe eternal soul wonder way remain buddhist give look like buddhist zen buddhist believe eternal soul,5,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,Philosophical Exploration,0.9719,,,positive

Westerners need to suspend their understanding of Heaven as received from Abrahamic sources in order to appreciate what Chinese might conceptualize. 

*Heaven* is often seen as an initiating principle which, in the manifest world, endows things with tendencies and dispositions in the form of spirit. This in complemented by *Earth, which represents the receptive (of what has been initiated) principle that nurtures and develops things. This accounts for all manifest things, hence the understanding the phrase *all under Heaven and Earth*, that is, all things manifest.

1kbc1bp,mpv69r4,t3_1kbc1bp,ryokan1973,"TIAN 天. Heaven, Heavenly, the Heavens, Sky, Skylike, Celestial. The first thing any non-Chinese reader should understand about tian is that no one in the history of Chinese thought ever doubts its existence. Even the most skeptical thinker would not deny the existence of tian; rather, he would say that tian exists and that it is simply that blue sky above us. This makes the term very unlike “God” and its equivalents in Western traditions, and perhaps closer to “Nature,” which similarly is something the existence of which is never contested. In both cases the only issue is not whether it exists but what its character is: personal, impersonal, deliberate, nondeliberate, spiritual, material, moral, amoral, conscious, unconscious. This primary meaning of “sky” is never absent in the word, in its most rudimentary and undeniable sense: what is up there above the reach of human beings, where weather comes from, which changes through the seasons and thus sets the conditions for all human activity but is beyond human manipulation. That contrast to purposive human activity remains the core element in the idea of tian no matter what further content is added: tian is what is not accomplished by any deliberate human actions, but which conditions human actions. But “sky” also functioned as a metonym for whatever deity or deities may be living in the sky, much as the “White House” is sometimes used to refer to the president of the United States, or “Hollywood” is used to designate a complex collective conglomerate entity like “the movie industry.” It was so used to designate the ancestral deity or deities of the Zhou imperial house, whose moral “mandate” underwrote the Zhou overthrow of the Shang dynasty in the eleventh century BCE. Tian in this usage tended to function as a patriarchal sky-god of the kind typical of many ancient cultures. With the rationalizing tendencies of the Spring and Autumn Period (770–475 BCE), however, including the early Confucian movement, the naturalistic association with “sky” began to grow more pronounced as the anthropomorphic and morally retributive aspects of the term were dampened. In the Analects, Confucius sometimes uses the term with clear but possibly rhetorical anthropomorphic implications, but elsewhere in the same work he states that Heaven “does not speak \[that is, issues no explicit commands\], and yet the four seasons proceed through it, the hundred creatures are born through it” (Analects 17:19). The naturalistic sense of Heaven as the plain process of the sky seems to be present in this pronouncement. Interpretive hedgings continued in the work of Zhuangzi’s contemporary Mencius, representing what would later be deemed the mainstream Confucian tradition. Mencius sometimes reduced the meaning of Heaven explicitly to simply “what happens although nothing makes it happen” (Mencius, 5A6). This is the sense of the term that emerges front and center in Zhuangzi’s usage: the spontaneous and agentless process that brings forth all beings, or a collective name for whatever happens without a specific identifiable agent that makes it happen and without a preexisting purpose or will or observable procedure. This is “skylike” in the sense that the sky is conceived as the ever-present but unspecifiable open space that “rotates” tirelessly and spontaneously, bringing the changes of the seasons and the bounty of the earth forth without having to issue explicit orders, make or enforce “laws” or directly interfere: the turning of the sky makes the harvest without coming down and planning and planting, its action is effortless and purposeless. The Heavenly in all things is this “skylike” aspect of all things. The term “Nature” has been used by some early translators, but the implication of Nature as an ordered and knowable system, running according to “Natural Laws,” which are rooted in the wisdom of a divine lawgiver, is profoundly alien to the early Chinese conception of spontaneity, which excludes the notion of positive law as an externally constraining force. Since the term no longer refers to a particular agent but to a quality or aspect of purposeless and agentless process present in all existents, it is here often translated as “the Heavenly” rather than the substantive “Heaven.” But the English “Heavenly” should not be taken in its loose colloquial sense as an exclamation of praise meaning something like “simply marvelous!” Similarly, the English term “Heaven” should be stripped of any implications of a pearly-gated place of reward to which people go when they die.

In the Analects, Confucius sometimes uses the term with clear but possibly rhetorical anthropomorphic implications, but elsewhere in the same work he states that Heaven “does not speak \[that is, issues no explicit commands\], and yet the four seasons proceed through it, the hundred creatures are born through it” (Analects 17:19). The naturalistic sense of Heaven as the plain process of the sky seems to be present in this pronouncement. Interpretive hedgings continued in the work of Zhuangzi’s contemporary Mencius, representing what would later be deemed the mainstream Confucian tradition. Mencius sometimes reduced the meaning of Heaven explicitly to simply “what happens although nothing makes it happen” (Mencius, 5A6). This is the sense of the term that emerges front and center in Zhuangzi’s usage: the spontaneous and agentless process that brings forth all beings, or a collective name for whatever happens without a specific identifiable agent that makes it happen and without a preexisting purpose or will or observable procedure. This is “skylike” in the sense that the sky is conceived as the ever-present but unspecifiable open space that “rotates” tirelessly and spontaneously, bringing the changes of the seasons and the bounty of the earth forth without having to issue explicit orders, make or enforce “laws” or directly interfere: the turning of the sky makes the harvest without coming down and planning and planting, its action is effortless and purposeless. The Heavenly in all things is this “skylike” aspect of all things. The term “Nature” has been used by some early translators, but the implication of Nature as an ordered and knowable system, running according to “Natural Laws,” which are rooted in the wisdom of a divine lawgiver, is profoundly alien to the early Chinese conception of spontaneity, which excludes the notion of positive law as an externally constraining force. Since the term no longer refers to a particular agent but to a quality or aspect of purposeless and agentless process present in all existents, it is here often translated as “the Heavenly” rather than the substantive “Heaven.” But the English “Heavenly” should not be taken in its loose colloquial sense as an exclamation of praise meaning something like “simply marvelous!” Similarly, the English term “Heaven” should be stripped of any implications of a pearly-gated place of reward to which people go when they die.

Yes I agree, buddhism should be against this idea of shiny souls. It just so happens that most buddhists aren't against it. They obsess over it.

Yes remembering things from past lives or being impacted by the actions of past lives is an eternal soul. You want these next lives to be good, by polishing your ghost as much as possible. A ghost isn't a real thing in this world - it's supernatural. We imply a ghost's supernatural existence because of the impact of supernatural events. One person dying then another person having memories of that dead person is, if confirmed and without other natural explanation, is strong evidence of supernatural ghosts existing. Souls are always thought of as existing in this supernatural sense - implied by the occurence of supernatural events e.g. prophets, speaking with dead, etc. Saying it's not a ghost even though you are saying one dead persons memories are showing up in another living person, is simply word games to avoid admitting you believe in eternal souls.

Just focusing on you then, do you believe one of the benefits of your spiritual practice (meditation, praying, being moral etc) is that your next life would be better for it? (I'm not asking if that's a motivation, just whether as a fact it is a benefit).

EDIT: To anyone else reading, the usual response is, person A dies, and later on another person B is born, and with nothing occurring in between the chain of person A's experiences continues in person B. For instance, if A was good their whole life, good things will happen to B, and if A was a brilliant teacher, then B might be a brilliant teacher too. There are all kinds of variations to this, but the response to why it's not a soul is that many aspects aren't carrying through - but memories, purpose, karma etc are carrying through. At best this is an argument that buddhists believe in a partial eternal soul, but that seems silly as many religions that believe in eternal souls also believe in partial eternal souls e.g. Christians who don't believe marriage exists in heaven, as heaven doesn't have the same kind of life.

1kbihn4,mpvrbfs,t1_mpvi1fa,neidanman,"when you say a cycle what do you mean? does it feel like a cycle of energy moving around in the area in a cycle? If so these are quite normal. Depending on the strength of the cycle and how established it is, it can be clearer more or less quickly. The basic method uses a principle called 'yi dao qi dao' - where the awareness goes, the qi follows. This is how people can end up clearing things by leading energy round, like if you try and use it to do the MCO.

So if you think the cycle is a bit like an area of dirt that has been worn into a groove, and now energy is just cycling round and round, you need to cut across/breakup the edges of the groove. Depending on where you are in your development you'll be able to lead more or less energy to the area to do this, so this also impacts how much effect you can have.

One main point when doing it is to focus on a tiny part of the edge and put all your energy across it, back and forwards. This focusing is a bit like using a nail to break a sheet of tough glass, rather than a fist. The more concentrated the energy, the more easy it is to break up the cycles.

kundalini and eastern practices are often misunderstood. my practice has been through daoist arts since '98. Also i've been looking into the theory side more for the past 10 years or so. i wouldn't say the cycles are especially linked to either tradition. Kundalini has a potentially 'obvious' but incorrect mention of it in terms of the coiled serpant (spiral energy). Repeating cycles though are more linked to samskaras/sankharas, or 'tethers' in daoism. These are more individual cycles that can come up in any part of the system.

tingling at the spine is also common in both, as both have an aspect where qi/prana/kundalini makes its way up through the spine. Heat is also common in both. The connection of the roof of the mouth and tongue is mentioned in daoist arts as part of the 'ren channel', which goes down the front of the body. The tongue touching the mouth roof is seen as helping to connect this channel/be a part of it. Kundalini based practices also use this.

The roof of the mouth is an area known for having a 'granthi' on the kundalini side - a particularly difficult energetic knot that needs undone/cleared.

1kbihn4,mpw15mh,t1_mpvrbfs,SunnyDD000,"So I can try to explain the cycle. It starts at the perineum area and it feels like a constant pumping motion (sometimes like twirling pumping motion, sometimes just straight upwards), through the entire core of my torso and then to my neck up to my tongue and then to the head. This is always constant. The back part of my neck is where the energy will be hot and then sometimes in my face. 

As for my tongue, the cycle is tongue presses upwards naturally, and the flow in one motion moves from perineum, spike/torso, neck and to the base of tongue to the tip of tongue. From the tip of tongue, the energy does this downward loop and then gets both sides of the tongue in the back. Sometimes it will be more apparent on one side - and then it the energy goes up through the palate. Behind my eyes or center of the bridge of my nose.

1kbihn4,mpw8xqs,t1_mpw15mh,neidanman,"sure i think i get it more now. The closest thing i know from experience was having waves of energy come up from the base, pass through the body, then usually release out the top of the head, but sometimes get 'stuck' part way up. They would come in batches going for up to an hour or so, and would be in waves every second/few seconds. They lasted on and off for a month or so and mostly happened at night, but at other times too.

from what i can tell/compare it to, its part of a purification of the system. The yogic system talks of it as part of either a pranotthana or kundalini process, [http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1970s/1979/7903/7903prkn.html](http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1970s/1979/7903/7903prkn.html) . Daoism talks of it as 'post heaven qi' clearing 'turbid qi'. Its not something you would normally want to adjust, more you would want to let it play out and clear/adjust the system as needed. Both systems view this level of energy as having its own intelligence and we basically apply 'non doing' awareness to what's going on, to work with it and help the process play out - this is a short take on the daoist view of this in practice [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmIe5jWBYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmIe5jWBYY)

active practices at this stage then are more there to help things go more smoothly and that aim to make the work of the energy more easy. Some from the first link that might help are - 

Practicing 'ting & song' - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1y\_aeCYj9c&t=998s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1y_aeCYj9c&t=998s) \- Roughly this means to listen/sense inwardly & release. The video is a \~4 min answer section from an interview explaining it.

Song - [https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-five-theory-wu-ji-and-song-relaxation/](https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-five-theory-wu-ji-and-song-relaxation/) \- Conscious/knowing release can be used to help open the body. As it opens it can become more conductive to energy. So energy that has been blocked may be freed up and start flowing away from wherever its pooled.

Dissolving/clearing blocks - [https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-six-theory-dissolving-clearing-blockages/](https://www.internalartsinternational.com/free/daoist-meditation-lesson-six-theory-dissolving-clearing-blockages/) \- Moving awareness to the blockage, rather than the buildup of energy can help to dissolve it. E.g. with a energy built in the head, you can move the awareness into the 'dead space' around the energy, and this can lead the energy into 'dissolving' the block.

Soft-butter method - [https://buddhismnow.com/2015/09/12/zen-sickness-by-zen-master-hakuin/#:\~:text=The%20Soft%2DButter%20Method](https://buddhismnow.com/2015/09/12/zen-sickness-by-zen-master-hakuin/#:~:text=The%20Soft%2DButter%20Method) \- Visualisation is used here to try and help guide energy down from the head to the rest of the body.

It was written very differently than other kinds of screenplays and I assume the same is true about the book. 
It had a charm to it, I’d recommend checking it out.
Approaching the writing with a childlike view and wonder of the world is probably what sets it apart.

From the Dao De Jing, chapter 64:

Act before there is a problem.
Bring order before there is disorder.
A tree that fills the arms' embrace is born from a downy shoot.
A terrace nine layers high
starts from a basketful of earth.
An ascent of a hundred strides begins beneath one's foot.

To me I gain two lessons from this for my writing. Acting before there is a problem to me is about foresight, I outline my stories beforehand so when I get to the next chapter I already know what to write about, but take that in moderation.

Yes - that's not daoist. At least not Classic Daoism. There is no ""Karma"" in classic Daoism. Only in late branches blended with Buddhism.

Jing ( Life seed / essence) and Qi (Life breath / energy) are giving birth and Life and De (profound virtue, potency, power) nurtures Life and protects it and brings Life to fulness - before it returns ( Laozi 51, 40).

When Jing and Qi are depleted and dispersed, Life (sheng / ming) ends and form (xing) decreases and changes (hua).

The wise man (Sheng ren) or the true man (Zhen ren) understands and welcomes this process of Life and Death. That's about calmness (jing) in and acceptance of change (hua).

Some Daoists try to stop that process - those are the Xian (immortals) and the Neidans (Inner Alchemy).

1k9zjfa,mpiexyd,t3_1k9zjfa,Delicious_Block_9253,"The history of the Dao De Jing is debated. Lots of people don't think Laozi existed, and that the book was a bunch of folk wisdom/sayings written down, and probably well before Confucius. Stories about Confucius and Laozi meeting are common, and that likely has to do with people repeating them to support a certain point they're making (for example, a common story is that Confucius was seeking Laozi's wisdom, which proves some people's point that Taoism is better than Confucianism).

  
It's probably not the most useful or accurate to reduce Confucianism to rigid, misogynistic views, OR to reduce Daoism to opposing them. Both traditions have had/have misogynists and feminists, people in support or against a given social policy or leader, etc. explicit or otherwise. I think it is fair to say that Confucianism tends to focus more on the human world and believes there is more of a place for intentionally designed, top-down social organization, but the Dao De Jing can be read as a manual for those ruling a country and has many passages obviously directed at national leaders - implying that it sees social hierarchy as, at the very least, a truth we have to navigate, and maybe even natural and good, when done right. I think it's also fair to say that Daoism tends to emphasize naturalness, and following the way of nature instead of rigid human ideas of proper conduct, but Confucianism certainly has these elements as well - Confucius writes about the 道 (dao) - the same word that gives us Daoism. Confucianism has been used by many progressives to argue for progressive ideas. To some degree, there's an argument that these categories, along with other philosophical schools in China, came well after the texts were written - a more recent invention.

  
I think one of the strongest ways to show this point is that all throughout history, all the way to the present day, many people (of a broad range of political/philosophical beliefs) practice/follow Daoism \*\*and\*\* Confucianism \*\*and\*\* Buddhism \*\*and\*\* Indigenous Folk Religions \*\*and\*\* plenty of other things, all at the same time. These are big philosophical traditions that don't fit neatly into the boxes we have in the West. While there's certainly a dialogue between these traditions, and it has been, at times, very adversarial, it has at other times been mutually enriching. For example, the I Ching, considered a foundational scripture of Daoism, was one of the texts most analyzed by early Confucian scholars, and the commentaries on it that almost anyone who studies it (including Daoists) were written by Confucians.

Using Daoist philosophy itself to make this point, the ""yin"" of Daoism requires the ""yang"" of Confucianism for balance. To understand things well, we shouldn't only look at one and ignore the other. Or, from another perspective, ideas, like water, are inclusive and flow naturally. Ideas from Daosim came to Confucianism, and vice versa, and those ideas exist in individual minds as a broad variety of nuanced perspectives.

Confucius wasn't some malicious psychopath looking to oppress children and women. He was very much an empathetic sage concerned with optimizing wellbeing of humans in harmony with nature. He accounted for both the roles of men and women and thought of systems to enforce their respective duties in a way that doesn't put either party at disadvantage.

Of course it doesn't eliminate human suffering completely but our current chaotic structure doesn't eliminate it in the slightest either. With prescribed structure like Confucianism people set realistic expectations as it has law prescribed way of resolution of almost every standard situation.

>say your dad is an alcoholic and your mom is a prostitute.

This is a typical counter argument - but legalist systems eventually find ways to resolve such problems in literally the most optimal way.

Let's look at your example - what happens in western democracy? Kids are free to do whatever they want, disrespect their parents, etc. but they still are legally tied to them until they reach adult age. Help options are limited. Without proper upbringing they go feral, start forming violent gangs, get into drugs and end up on state's budget in prison. Worst case but increasingly common scenario - they die on the streets.

Legalist system has planned scenarios where neighbors report the parents and they simply remove the child - much similar to what we have now. They might set him up for army training, which probably sounds brutal to you at first. But such solution offers SEVERAL advantages over time:

* Parents are legally threatened to have their children taken away, much like they currently are in many developed democracies.
* The capacity for army training is unlimited, they pay for their education and make them relatively well-adjusted members of society.
* State gains from this loyal and highly motivated soldiers for their military AND IMPORTANTLY in return also is bound to give them ranks and retire them at legally defined age.
* In current system there are extremely limited ways out of poverty and joining the army is likely one of the best options one can make in such scenario, especially if the other option consists of playing war on the streets.

Specific example:  
*Legal codes criminalised abandonment: if a child died after being left without care, the parent could be charged with “killing a minor relative”, punished by strangulation (Tang and Ming codes). If the child survived, the parent still faced 100 blows and exile. In Qing times each prefecture was ordered to maintain an official* ***foundling home*** *(1720 edict), though funding was uneven.*

TLDR: **People bring up specific measures from Confucianist and Legalist practices and completely ignore much more massive and radical counter-measures.** How bad would you have to fuck your parent's shit up before they report you for disobedience, especially  if they know there's death penalty for it? It's much easier for a child to report their parents (much like they do in our current system) and penalties are much more strict for it than today.",2,1745948446.0,6,view confucianism simply describe natural hierarchical structure society effective self regulatory practice wrong light completely reason confucius malicious psychopath look oppress child woman empathetic sage concern optimize wellbeing human harmony nature account role man woman thought system enforce respective duty way party disadvantage course eliminate human suffering completely current chaotic structure eliminate slight prescribed structure like confucianism people set realistic expectation law prescribe way resolution standard situation dad alcoholic mom prostitute typical counter argument legalist system eventually find way resolve problem literally optimal way let look example happen western democracy kid free want disrespect parent etc legally tie reach adult age help option limited proper upbringing feral start form violent gang drug end state budget prison bad case increasingly common scenario die street legalist system plan scenario neighbor report parent simply remove child similar set army training probably sound brutal solution offer advantage time parent legally threaten child take away like currently developed democracy capacity army training unlimited pay education relatively adjust member society state gain loyal highly motivated soldier military importantly return bind rank retire legally define age current system extremely limited way poverty join army likely good option scenario especially option consist play war street specific example legal code criminalise abandonment child die leave care parent charge kill minor relative punish strangulation tang ming code child survive parent face 100 blow exile qe time prefecture order maintain official foundle home 1720 edict funding uneven tldr people bring specific measure confucianist legalist practice completely ignore massive radical counter measure bad fuck parent shit report disobedience especially know death penalty easy child report parent like current system penalty strict today,8,Confucian Sociopolitical Discourse,Philosophical Exploration,-0.9917,,,negative

Still, people who rejected Nazi regimes made exactly 0 difference - the regime only failed because Germany got defeated in war, not because of some non-conformists.

Are you familiar with I Ching -  Book of Changes? Confucius held this ancient book in the highest regard and he and his school wrote extensive commentaries on it. The book itself served as a basis for both the Confucianist ethics AND Taoist canon is largely based on that book. Even multiple passages and concepts presented in Tao Te Ching can be directly traced back to it. 

The whole idea of that book is to describe universal natural patterns using 64 hexagrams representing archetypal situations, which can be applied to literally anything including agriculture, family relationships and government. It's essentially a model of every possible situation one can get into and includes Judgements on the most optimal course of action for each. This optimal course of action is what's been later called the Tao - the books predates the concept of Tao by almost a millennium. 

Taoism and Confucianism are not opposing doctrines. Even Confucius himself used the word Tao. He just took a different approach to it's practical application - inspired by the ancient Book of Changes he attempted to design an ideal system of government and ethics modeled after what's natural. You even agree to this when you say ""a 6ft male with being subservient to a 5ft tall woman is unnatural and unbalanced"".

He simply chose to leave the areas of spirituality and individual well-being to other sages. That's why Confucianism historically existed *concurrently and in harmony* with both Taoism and Buddhism. 

For Taoist living in a Confucianist state is really the perfect combination because you are always able to easily read every situation and react accordingly. When the role of father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, lord and servant are all clearly defined, it becomes much easier to just go with the flow. 

Nowadays the lords (which we call CEOs) are free to place the burden of responsibility on servants (which we call employees) - because on paper we are all socially equal and all on the ""same team"". In a rigid system servant is a dependent of his lord, much like a child is a dependent of its parents. Lord has essentially unlimited power over his servant but it's completely balanced by the weight of responsibility this comes with. 

Amazon treats their employees like shit but nobody cares because ""it's a free market and it's well within the bounds of law"". If a person doesn't do well these days we simply say they are not trying hard enough in life, put all the blame on poor peasants. In the days of Confucius, if a servants were treated poorly it would destroy the image of the lord and others would condemn his actions because associating with such man would destroy their image as well.",1,1745999510.0,3,okay system inherently bad system base natural pattern create harmony automatically correct toxic behavior example non conformity system base discrimination unsustainable people reject nazi regime exactly difference regime fail germany get defeat war non conformist familiar ching book change confucius hold ancient book high regard school write extensive commentary book serve basis confucianist ethic taoist canon largely base book multiple passage concept present tao ching directly trace idea book describe universal natural pattern hexagram represent archetypal situation apply literally include agriculture family relationship government essentially model possible situation include judgement optimal course action optimal course action later call tao book predate concept tao millennium taoism confucianism oppose doctrine confucius word tao take different approach practical application inspire ancient book change attempt design ideal system government ethic model natural agree male subservient tall woman unnatural unbalanced simply choose leave area spirituality individual sage confucianism historically exist concurrently harmony taoism buddhism taoist live confucianist state perfect combination able easily read situation react accordingly role father mother son daughter husband wife lord servant clearly define easy flow nowadays lord ceo free place burden responsibility servant employee paper socially equal team rigid system servant dependent lord like child dependent parent lord essentially unlimited power servant completely balance weight responsibility come amazon treat employee like shit care free market bound law person day simply try hard life blame poor peasant day confucius servant treat poorly destroy image lord condemn action associate man destroy image,-1,,,0.8272,,,positive

1k9zjfa,mptoxkf,t1_mptdu4e,60109,"I thought you were being sarcastic at first about wanting to be educated on it. Sorry for misunderstanding.

I Ching started off as a divinatory system but compared to Tarot which is only a few hundreds years old, I Ching was refined over thousands of years. It's essentially an enclosed 6-bit binary system consisting of hexagrams with alternating values of yin (broken line) and yang (solid line) as you correctly pointed out. Fun fact: binary mathematics in the west were invented by Liebniz after he translated I Ching and he even attributed his discovery to it.

Now unlike Tarot who was practiced by occultists in secrecy and in periphery, I Ching was at the center stage during the early Chinese history, as divination was one of the domains reserved for the ruling class. Imagine all greatest philosophers and sages collaboratively working on a system of associations which would cover the entire spectrum of all possible situations.

That's also the grand purpose of I Ching - describe in the 64 archetypal images all the possible situations (or 'Changes') that could happen in every possible area. That might sound like an insanely ambitious goal from our current western rationalist perspective. 

The way ancient sages (history is blurry at this stage) did this by defining the first two hexagrams Qian (the Creative, heaven, all yang lines) and Kun (the Receptive, earth, all yin lines) as the points of reference. Every other situation is then defined as a place between those 2 extremes. If you imagine it like a color spectrum the remaining hexagrams attempt to cover every kind of color by being spread out evenly over the spectrum with equal spaces between them. 

In certain situations despite them being distinct, similar parts of the brain activate and similar thought processes arise. It took thousands of years but I Ching is essentially a human brain-map. In it there is encoded optimal solution for every practical problem. It's basically a complete guide book on how to approach any situation in harmony with the Tao. Taoists extracted their maxims from the practical advice presented in the book.

Now how it ties to Confucius and Legalism? Confucius recognized the ingeniousness of the book and decided to apply the clearly-defined structure of order and hierarchy into lawmaking. He basically took the blueprint (already refined over a thousand years during times of Confucius) and created the ""perfect"" government system in accordance with it. He simply had no underlying evil motivations and really just wanted to create peace and harmony in society. Similar ideas of perfect political systems have been proposed by Plato and Socrates but were never attempted to be put into practice unlike Confucianism.

1k8z5d7,mpa82c6,t3_1k8z5d7,ryokan1973,"Many existing popular translations of Chinese texts suffer from fundamental misunderstandings due to the translator's lack of knowledge of the language or, indeed, having no understanding of Classical Chinese at all. Consequently, these translations frequently invent or omit entire words and sentences in an attempt to enhance comprehension, which results in a significant distortion of Laozi's original words and intentions.

To address this issue, I advocate for a more balanced approach. A skilled translator should possess a deep understanding of Classical Chinese and a deep knowledge of all the rival philosophical schools (especially Ruism) in the Warring States period of pre-Qin China, allowing them to remain faithful to the original meanings and intent while eschewing excessively literal translations that risk obscuring Laozi's profound wisdom. Additionally, engaging with high-quality commentaries alongside the text can greatly enhance the reading experience.

I recommend you read this downloadable PDF translation that achieves this balance of accuracy and readability, accompanied by insightful commentaries that illuminate the text’s depth. The translator also has a background in martial arts:-

1k8z5d7,mpi4ge1,t3_1k8z5d7,Delicious_Block_9253,"**TLDR:** watch the Benebell Wen Youtube videos I linked, read the Addiss/Lombardo translation, and/or read the Ames and Hall translation (especially intro and commentaries) if you're up for some technical language. Read the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/) article. Skim through what I've written below and see if there's anything else that piques your interest.

**My biggest recommendation** is to check out Benebell Wen'a YouTube channel. Start [here](https://youtu.be/ad54Mpm5UX0?si=0nKg5siCVd8cns6R) and [here (Wu Wei - Taoist Non-Action)](https://youtu.be/TzAFobogs3Q?si=4Dlutm5xCm7N3mjQ).

Whatever sources you use, focus on some of the following core ideas:
- Dao (Tao)
- De (Virtue)
- Wu Wei (Non-action)
- Ziran (Naturalness)
- Yin and Yang
- Pu (Uncarved Block)
- Qi (Vital Energy)
- The Sage

**Reading the Dao De Jing:**
It's not expected to be easy. It's poetic, so it takes work to get the meaning. As discussed in its first chapter, it's trying to explain something beyond words, so it has to be paradoxical and confusing at times, because words can't describe reality perfectly - reality isn't words. It helps to also have a meditation practice. If you don't understand something, stop reading and sit with that line. Think about multiple layers of meaning. Go slowly, maybe even just one chapter a day/sitting. Also, know that the language it is written in is so old that much of the meaning has been lost to changing character meanings, forgotten mythologies, common sayings that aren't around anymore etc. (but scholars often do a great job of figuring things out!). Basically, even PHDs who only study this one text are often confused too - whether its because they're also missing info, or because parts of the DDJ are *meant* to be ambiguous or have multiple meanings, or because any attempt to describe something beyond words is going to be confusing and fall flat in some ways. It's a book that can be interpreted as a manual for meditation, practical advice for life, a handbook for ruling a country, etc. so as you read, think about how you can apply advice/metaphors to your own life. To some degree, it's folk wisdom that's *meant* to have multiple interpretations and applications. Try to discuss with others to exchange understanding whether on here, in person, etc. learning is social! Consider making art about it, especially some of the rich images! If you're not averse to AI, I've found pasting a line in, turning on internet search mode, and asking ChatGPT to tell me about different interpretations helps a lot. It often searches chinese language blogs/books too!  

**Translation Options:**
Addiss and Lombardo is faithful but also accessible. I think it's my recommendation based on your post.
Ames and Hall is my favorite translation, and has very very useful commentaries, but uses lots of technical language. Probably the best intro and best commentaries out of any I've read.
Avoid Mitchell. He's dishonest and misrepresents the book. It's like he's getting it wrong on purpose.
Le Guin is decent and owns that it's not a translation, but if you pick Le Guin only use it as a supplement to something else. Definitely check out her other books though - one of my favorite authors and has Daoist ideas woven throughout.
Almost all of the other major translations are solid too, and its definitely great to compare multiple.
Source: have read ~10 translations and the text in Classical Chinese.

**I Ching and Zhuangzi** are two other good texts to check out as a beginner. I Ching can be even more poetic/hard to interpret. Zhuangzi has some parts that are more straightforward. Both can be found for free online, but my favorite translations are Benebell Wen for the I Ching and Brook Ziporyn for the Zhuangzi.

**Secondary books/overviews:** Mentioned above, but the intro to the Ames and Hall translation is one of the best overviews I've ever read. Articles on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy are great, go through ones that are interesting, and maybe start [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/). Tao of Pooh is okay but not always quite on point and the author has some wild ideas (even more obvious if you read the sequel). I like Alan Watt's the watercourse way. Good intro, very readable, philosophically accurate, had input (and was actually finished) by actual Daoists. You can find Alan Watts lectures on Daoism on YouTube that are generally quite accurate and easy to understand.

**Youtube:** Religion for Breakfast ([Daoism Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHsXddZFR9AMEFx_uyGN-ZMMeD37WAJvh&si=J3tCeD04CwyUH3XF), including videos like What is Daoism, understanding Wu Wei, ""Qi"" Explained: Ancient, Mystic Superpower? etc.) and Lets Talk Religion ([What is Daoism](https://youtu.be/fTPxh6Sn_gI?si=sB0sCEAo1tHAi8eX) [The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove](https://youtu.be/ODBMOCs1xe0?si=eIyCjVAcKNFFQ5o8) [Zhuangzi - The Sage of Uncertainty](https://youtu.be/KumY4dthQ4k?si=cqmGXYTc9wDDKCBm) [Internal Alchemy in Daoism](https://youtu.be/XcuNwDyFmkc?si=sEOVnSTnijWLA5-P)) and George Thompsom ([Taoism Explained by a Taoist Master](https://youtu.be/kij4kKSGzCE?si=1-3eDH2cJRb1niA9) [The Yin Yang](https://youtu.be/JJNEvjwipO0?si=DE6v8RuSNDTK--v3) [Zhuangzi Explained](https://youtu.be/piCfNls5gqE?si=FNTQf1DHPWt5OQk2)) have some great videos, more than just the ones linked.

**Compare to Other Philosophy:** Comparative philosophy/religion can deepen your understanding. Any mystical tradition has some overlaps (Sufism, Rumi, The Conference of the Birds, Christian mysticism, Neoplatonism, a lot of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, any animist tradition, etc.). Some good books are Non-Duality by David R Loy, Zen Flesh Zen Bones, The Spectrum of Consciousness, Wild Mind Wild Earth our Place in the Sixth Extinction, Sand Talk, Japanese Death Poems, anything by Nietzsche are all good books that directly or indirectly helped me understand Daoism. It's important to not conflate different traditions beliefs, but hearing people from all of the world express similar ideas in different ways helped me understand Daoism much better. In ancient Western philosophy, Stoicism (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus are good starting places) has some overlap. Heraclitus has a TON of overlap. Jung, Heidegger and Deleuze and many other modern thinkers draw on Daoism.

Daoism wasn't born in a vacuum, and is a lot more than just one text. Consider learning more about Confucianism, Buddhism (especially Chan aka Zen aka Thien which was heavily influenced by and influenced Daoism - Thich Nhat Hanh has great books for this), Chinese folk religion/mythology, Chinese poetry, internal alchemy, Chinese medicine, etc. Historically and today, many people practicing/following Daoism were/are also Buddhists/Confucians, had/have local religious beliefs, may practice divination and meditation, etc.",3,1745856412.0,0,tldr watch benebell wen youtube video link read addiss lombardo translation and/or read ame hall translation especially intro commentary technical language read stanford encyclopedia entry daoism/ article skim write pique interest big recommendation check benebell wen'a youtube channel start ad54mpm5ux0?si=0nkg5sicvd8cns6r wei taoist non tzafobogs3q?si=4dlutm5xcm7n3mjq source use focus follow core idea dao tao virtue wei non action ziran naturalness yin yang uncarved block vital energy sage read dao jing expect easy poetic take work meaning discuss chapter try explain word paradoxical confusing time word describe reality perfectly reality word help meditation practice understand stop read sit line think multiple layer meaning slowly maybe chapter day sitting know language write old meaning lose change character meaning forget mythology common saying anymore etc scholar great job figure thing basically phds study text confuse miss info part ddj mean ambiguous multiple meaning attempt describe word go confusing fall flat way book interpret manual meditation practical advice life handbook rule country etc read think apply advice metaphor life degree folk wisdom mean multiple interpretation application try discuss exchange understanding person etc learning social consider make art especially rich image averse find paste line turn internet search mode ask chatgpt tell different interpretation help lot search chinese language blog book translation option addiss lombardo faithful accessible think recommendation base post ame hall favorite translation useful commentary use lot technical language probably good intro good commentary read avoid mitchell dishonest misrepresent book like get wrong purpose guin decent own translation pick guin use supplement definitely check book favorite author daoist idea weave major translation solid definitely great compare multiple source read ~10 translation text classical chinese ching zhuangzi good text check beginner ching poetic hard interpret zhuangzi part straightforward find free online favorite translation benebell wen ching brook ziporyn zhuangzi secondary book overviews mention intro ame hall translation good overviews read article stanford encyclopedia philosophy internet encyclopedia philosophy great one interesting maybe start entry daoism/ tao pooh okay point author wild idea obvious read sequel like alan watt watercourse way good intro readable philosophically accurate input actually finish actual daoist find alan watts lecture daoism youtube generally accurate easy understand youtube religion breakfast daoism playlist?list plhsxddzfr9amefx_uygn zmmed37wajvh&si j3tced04cwyuh3xf include video like daoism understand wei explain ancient mystic superpower etc let talk religion ftpxh6sn_gi?si sb0sceao1thai8ex seven sage bamboo odbmocs1xe0?si eiycjvacknffq5o8 zhuangzi sage kumy4dthq4k?si cqmgxytc9wddkcbm internal alchemy xcunwdyfmkc?si seovnstnijwla5 george thompsom taoism explain taoist kij4kksgzce?si=1 3edh2cjrb1nia9 yin jjnevjwipo0?si de6v8rusndtk zhuangzi picfnls5gqe?si fntqf1dhpwt5oqk2 great video one link compare philosophy comparative philosophy religion deepen understanding mystical tradition overlap sufism rumi conference bird christian mysticism neoplatonism lot hindu buddhist philosophy animist tradition etc good book non duality david loy zen flesh zen bone spectrum consciousness wild mind wild earth place sixth extinction sand talk japanese death poem nietzsche good book directly indirectly help understand daoism important conflate different tradition belief hear people world express similar idea different way help understand daoism well ancient western philosophy stoicism marcus aurelius epictetus good start place overlap heraclitus ton overlap jung heidegger deleuze modern thinker draw daoism daoism bear vacuum lot text consider learn confucianism buddhism especially chan aka zen aka thien heavily influence influence daoism thich nhat hanh great book chinese folk religion mythology chinese poetry internal alchemy chinese medicine etc historically today people practice follow daoism buddhist confucian local religious belief practice divination meditation etc,5,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,Philosophical Exploration,0.9988,,,positive

1k9196f,mpbhh0d,t3_1k9196f,az4th,"Sure. Dragons relate to currents of flow. In feng shui, the dragons of the feng (wind) ride the terrain, like the mountain ridges, to create the currents in the wind. And the dragons of the shui (water) ride the qi that is absorbed into the flows of water, and are the life force within their water. 

Thus the principle and its naturalness is revealed. 

The spiritual dragons are the same. What distinguishes them from each other is the nature of the current they embody. 

Wang Liping, a Quan Zhen Longmen Pai adept who was taught by three daoist wayfarers, taught a meditation retreat in Russia, and someone recounted what happened. 

Heavy rain was forecast. And the retreat required doing work outdoors for some of it. The participants were sad that they might not be able to learn this work. Wang Liping said he would talk to the dragons about this. So he did, and the next day he said that they agreed to comply so that there would be no rain. There was no rain. 

In communicating with the dragons, he worked with the spirit of the weather currents. Expressing the need, and seeing if there was a path for them to accommodate that need by flowing in some other way. Such things are not to be forced, and yet if there is a way to harmoniously negotiate with the currents, such that harmony is preserved, then perhaps a way is found, or perhaps not. In connecting with the spirit of these currents, one taps into their divine nature and does not need to try to manipulate the currents forcefully. The spirit of these currents thus become known as dragons. 

So, what current does Shenloong embody? There you find Shenloong's nature and Shenloong's truth. 

As a representative of the currents that govern spiritual flow, Shenloong is part of the continuity of many of the other dragons, but more importantly is part of their link to heaven and continuity with the Heavenly Dragon, Tianloong, and is part of the web of currents that harmonize all spiritual flow throughout the universe.",6,1745764645.0,0,sure dragon relate current flow feng shui dragon feng wind ride terrain like mountain ridge create current wind dragon shui water ride absorb flow water life force water principle naturalness reveal spiritual dragon distinguish nature current embody wang liping quan zhen longman pai adept teach daoist wayfarer teach meditation retreat russia recount happen heavy rain forecast retreat require work outdoors participant sad able learn work wang liping say talk dragon day say agree comply rain rain communicate dragon work spirit weather current express need see path accommodate need flow way thing force way harmoniously negotiate current harmony preserve way find connect spirit current tap divine nature need try manipulate current forcefully spirit current know dragon current shenloong embody find shenloong nature shenloong truth representative current govern spiritual flow shenloong continuity dragon importantly link heaven continuity heavenly dragon tianloong web current harmonize spiritual flow universe,-1,,,0.9808,NEUTRAL,0.7566573619842529,positive

There are multiple pathways to heal the soul. We can take the lessons of the universe as a path. Or we can take stillness as a path. Either way, the soul is healed through the pressures that bring it back into its unified state, to attain some relative degree of freedom.

The way he explains it is via the lens of the hun ling (ethereal soul), the po ling (the corporeal/conscious soul), and the shen ling (the spiritual soul). 

The ethereal soul stores our memories.

The consciousness soul houses the mental constructs of our conscious ego-self.

When we die, if the hun ling and the po ling and the shen ling are not all one, then they separate from each other. 

If they separate:

* The corporeal soul returns to the earth with the weight of the unfinished business it was holding.

* The ethereal soul releases to the low levels of the spirit, along with its memories from this lifetime.

* The spiritual soul witnesses the memories, and reacts accordingly to create the spiritual curriculum for the next spiritual journey. When that spiritual soul is able to re-embody in life on earth again, it will continue with the curriculum it has. But until it is able to fully unify the heavy and light parts of its soul that form anew and are gathered in the lessons of old, it cannot attain its spiritual freedom. 

Spiritual freedom is granted by accomplishing this spiritual work. 

Stillness gathers spirit to us, and it gathers as we accomplish our spiritual curriculum. This spirit comes to us in the form of energy, information, and spiritual guides and helpers, who are drawn to us by the gravity of our spiritual work. 

In this way, what you say about spiritual freedom begin granted by sentient entities is resonant. They become drawn to us and work with us, and are part of the inherent nature of spiritual truth that determines how the curriculum is accomplished, and if not, what remains to be accomplished. 

They do not have the ability to change what is written, however. They simply flow with natural spiritual truth, and cannot deviate from natural spiritual law. They cannot bend any rules for us, and their judgment of us is impartial in every way. If we do the work, they help us. If we hope for some miracle that deviates from spiritual law, well they can't do anything about that. 

So yes, spiritual truth and spiritual reality is what decides the fate of our souls. 

It is based upon the accomplishment of our spiritual curriculum.

It was told by Zen Master Hsu Yun (虛雲 Xuyun), an enlightened master universally recognized by all Chinese Buddhists as being the greatest Zen monk of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not uncommon for Taoists and Buddhists to run into one another in the vast religious landscape of ancient China, and this was one of those encounters. The legend is about how Zen Master Huanglong enlightened Lu Dongbin who, up until their meeting, still suffered from egoism even though he was already a Taoist transcendent. It is said that out of all the Eight Immortals, Lu Dongbin was one of the wildest ones. At one time, he was flying over a Zen monastery located on Lushan and showing off his powers. He observed a purple cloud over the monastery which indicated that something deeply sacred was occurring beneath it. Lu Dongbin wanted to see what was going on, so he transformed himself into a Buddhist monk and entered the main hall of the monastery. The abbot, Zen Master Huanglong, was about to deliver a teaching, but he stopped and said, “I will not give my discourse today because there is a Dharma thief in our assembly.” Lu Dongbin then changed back into his actual form and stepped forward. He arrogantly asked the master, “Please explain to me what is meant by the Buddhist saying ‘A grain of corn can contain the universe, and mountains and rivers can fit into a small cooking pot.’” Zen Master Huanglong laughed and called him a “corpse guarding demon” (i.e. one who is attached to his physical body which is actually something impermanent). Lu Dongbin did not understand that the actual nature of all phenomena is characterized by emptiness. He still held onto the erroneous view that the self was something real and permanent. Lu Dongbin told Huanglong, “My gourd is filled with the elixir of immortality.” Huanglong then said “Even if you are able to live for eighty thousand (i.e. countless) aeons, you still cannot avoid falling into the void!” This angered Lu Dongbin so he unleashed his magical sword and threw it at Huanglong. The Zen master merely pointed his finger at the sword and it dropped to the ground. Lu Dongbin attempted to retrieve his sword but it wouldn’t move. He was astonished that a Zen master could be so powerful. He dropped to his knees in respect and pleaded with Huanglong to enlighten him. Huanglong then explained that the mind that gives form to what it labels “a grain of corn” is the same mind that gives form to what it labels “the universe.” All things and concepts are actually mind-created. To attain true enlightenment, one must relinquish all mental fabrications which include concepts, judgments, differentiations, opinions, and ego. Lu Dongbin pondered on this profound teaching and became awakened. He was thereafter also made a Dharmapala (guardian of the Buddhist teachings).

This continues our conversation nicely. 

Returning to Heaven, and returning the soul to its heavenly state - something of the utmost of yang, the golden elixir - is only part of what is possible. It is a return to the potency of pure energy. 

But it is still divided from the other half of itself that it originally came from. 

The received Gu San Fen tells us a version of the cosmological unfolding that I rather resonate with:

Clear Qi not yet rising,  
Unclear Qi not yet sinking,  
Drifting Shen (spirit/godliness) not yet Ling (embodied as a soul),  
The Five Hues not yet divided.  

Existing within this phenomena,  
Darkness, obscurity, and yet Xing (innate nature) is present,  
This is named Hun Dun (inchoate chaos).   

Hun Dun manifests the Great Inception.  

As for the Great Inception,  
It is sprouts and new beginnings of this preeminent womb,  
Great Inception's numeric is ONE,  
ONE manifests Tai Ji (The Great Pole/Extremity - the Big Bang),  
As for Tai Ji,  
It is due to being Heaven and Earth's mother and father.  

ONE is the Pole of Change,  
Heaven is exalted and luminous and therefore clear,  
Earth is widespread and capacious and therefore unclear,  
This is named Great Change.  

As for Great Change,  
It is due to Heaven and Earth's activated changing,  
Great Change's numeric is TWO, 
TWO manifests duality,  
As for duality,  
It is due to yin and yang's manifested forms,  
This is named Great Birth.  


Because of this, attaining the golden elixir and the ability to return to heaven, one has negotiated the division between living and dying. But not between being and non-being. 

Lu Dongbin needed to learn that his attainment was not complete. 

And in this version of the story (the only one I've read about), he was humbled by Huangloong and learned that he had more cultivation work to do, so that he could return his yang to its true source in dao prior to the existance of heaven.",5,1745772567.0,0,training akashic record reading western equivalent ask jeffrey yuen longmen pai jade purity lineage holder explain daoist perspective akashic record relate download information hun soul energy past discover past life reconnect reason current curriculum connect sort question record universe apparently dongbin kill huangloong form huangdi representation wuxing buddhist monk happen yellow loong resonate zen comments/4yl4k5 lu_dongbin_battle_and_enlightenment_with_monk/ version story resonate transmit teaching dongbin interesting story buddhist tradition call dongbin unleash sword cut huanglong 呂洞賓飛劍斬黃龍 dongbin feijian zhan huanglong tell zen master hsu yun xuyun enlightened master universally recognize chinese buddhist great zen monk 19th 20th century uncommon taoist buddhist run vast religious landscape ancient china encounter legend zen master huanglong enlighten dongbin meeting suffer egoism taoist transcendent say immortal dongbin wild one time fly zen monastery locate lushan show power observe purple cloud monastery indicate deeply sacred occur beneath dongbin want go transform buddhist monk enter main hall monastery abbot zen master huanglong deliver teaching stop say discourse today dharma thief assembly dongbin change actual form step forward arrogantly ask master explain mean buddhist say grain corn contain universe mountain river fit small cooking pot zen master huanglong laugh call corpse guard demon i.e. attach physical body actually impermanent dongbin understand actual nature phenomenon characterize emptiness hold erroneous view self real permanent dongbin tell huanglong gourd fill elixir immortality huanglong say able live eighty thousand i.e. countless aeon avoid fall void anger dongbin unleash magical sword throw huanglong zen master merely point finger sword drop ground dongbin attempt retrieve sword astonish zen master powerful drop knee respect plead huanglong enlighten huanglong explain mind give form label grain corn mind give form label universe thing concept actually mind create attain true enlightenment relinquish mental fabrication include concept judgment differentiation opinion ego dongbin ponder profound teaching awakened dharmapala guardian buddhist teaching continue conversation nicely return heaven return soul heavenly state utmost yang golden elixir possible return potency pure energy divide half originally come receive san fen tell version cosmological unfolding resonate clear rise unclear sink drift shen spirit godliness le embody soul hue divide exist phenomena darkness obscurity xing innate nature present name hun dun inchoate chaos hun dun manifest great inception great inception sprout new beginning preeminent womb great inception numeric manifest tai great pole extremity big bang tai heaven earth mother father pole change heaven exalt luminous clear earth widespread capacious unclear name great change great change heaven earth activate change great change numeric manifest duality duality yin yang manifest form name great birth attain golden elixir ability return heaven negotiate division living die non dongbin need learn attainment complete version story read humble huangloong learn cultivation work return yang true source dao prior existance heaven,5,Metaphysical Interpretations of Taoism,Philosophical Exploration,0.9991,,,positive

He took the ""idea"" of attainment too seriously and created, in his mind, an idea of attainment and then decided he had accomplished something of true value. 

Then, he enjoyed going around showing off to everyone, essentially,in his mind, saying, ""Everyone, look at me and my attainment! Aren't I wonderful!"" 

The Zen Master informed him he was full of bs and too impressed with himself.

He told him he was still trapped by a game of his own ego creation and thinking it actually meant something. 

He told the Taoist, even his pretend attainment is an impermanent game created by his mind, and it was this action of his mind that kept him trapped. 

He was trapping himself.

When the Taoist recognized it was all mind playing with mind and not real, he was realeased from the trap of his own construction and became truly free.

1k90wff,mpfo2fp,t1_mpcpeyp,az4th,"So in the west Akashic Record reading is just the name that stuck. I seems to have originated from Theosophy yes, but became more popularized by Edgar Cayce and his prophetic work, and the name became something that was used by people who followed, regardless of their religious backgrounds. 

As Jeffrey Yuen revealed, this is just something someone who is adept in shen gong - spiritual work - can do. And it is done just by opening up the records of something. 

The way I was a taught, we could go to a spiritual hall of records, and be asked to be shown anything. By the time I shared Jeffrey's explanation with my teacher, they were already just accessing the records directly themselves. 

Let's see, you mentioned this in your edit, after I had agreed with the first part:

> I was taught that our actions in aligning our nature with that which is desired by the gods results in the gods granting us a place amongst them... or not.

> e: in the shangqing school of taoism it was said if you read the texts 10000 times you will assuredly have cultivated the way and will certainly become immortal.

> so this is not an isolated teaching if it was also taught in Shangqing that cultivation was the path.

So the first part is the important part, and different schools will have different approaches to this. I am not as familiar with Shang Qing work. The concept you are referring to, seems to be reading the Dadong Zhenjing 10,000 times and allowing one to attain immortality without cultivation of the golden elixir. The process is described [here](https://en.daoinfo.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Book_of_the_Great_Grotto_of_the_Highest_Clarity). It resonates in principle with what I described earlier about what would be necessary in order to gain the aid of deities to help one with the work.

But to me, the work is still ultimately the same. The work one does to call down dieties into the various organs, vs the work to cultivate spiritual flow through the organs - they are both accomplishing the same elixir in the end.

Whether neidan, or this ShangQing work, there are a lot of parts to navigate. But if we're thinking about it all, then the mind gets in the way, so the mind needs to learn about these things then be clear of them. In the end, the process is all natural, and we just need to become empty so that it is able connect and flow within us on its own - whether spirits or gods, they are the same Shen, IMO.

Seeing that this path is possible, and getting results with this path, are two different things. 

With neidan it is important to find a teacher. Because we all have blind spots. And the teacher, having resolved their blind spots to see clearly, can help guide us past them, and guide us to see them ourselves. 

It is like trying to walk in a circle in the woods while blind folded. We struggle to know when we are veering from the proper turns, unless someone can help us show that our tendency, in one particular part of the circle, is to go wide. And in another part of the circle we stop turning at all for some reason. 

Only once we have resolved our imbalances and blind spots, can we begin to work reliably on our own - though in the end, doing our own work is what is required. 

Lu Dongbin is also responsible for the *transmission* of the ""Secret of the Golden Flower."" Perhaps it came through to Wang Chongyang. In any case, it is at the foundation of QuanZhen work, along with the Zhong Lu Chuan Dao Ji and the Ling Bao Bi Fa. 

It can help one develop the spiritual light that can connect with one's yuanshen (original spirit), which is the substance of the xing (inner nature) we are cultivating. 

This text says that once we are able to concentrate this light within, we just need to circulate it within and it will help us pass through all the stages of cultivation. Thus it becomes something simple. 

This is very similar to the idea of gathering the spiritual deities into one's organs. 

Because 神 shen refers to the same basic thing that is used to accomplish the work. We can refer to it as pure spiritual energy. And we can also refer to it as the spiritual entities that are part of its sentient flow in its circulation of oneness. But in the end, drawing the flow of 神 through us, helps us complete our soul. 

So in some way this is something simple. 

And you may find some success in utilizing this method - the Secret of the Golden Flower, to accomplish connection with 神. 

Wang Liping, a modern Longmen Pai Quan Zhen teacher, took some people into a retreat to work with this text, and a journalist documented that work, which is roughly translated [here](https://www.thedaobums.com/topic/37319-wang-liping-the-secret-of-the-golden-flower/). 

However, as we find, Xing work is preceded by Ming work. Why? So that the energy of the body can manifest the fuel required to concentrate the spiritual light. 

Once we have concentrated the spiritual light, we can turn it within and that spiritual light can then help to replenish the energy of the body. 

It is like working for a paycheck, but needing to eat first, so that one can show up and do the work. They mutually support each other. If one is tired, one can barely hope to think. And so first, we need to cultivate the energy of the body. There are various ways to do this. Once one is able to get into a meditative routine and concentrate the spiritual light and work with it reliably, one tends to know what is required to maintain this work. 

But generally, this is what a teacher is going to be helpful for. Few of us are innately gifted enough to be able to just show up and do this without instruction. Everyone is different and everyone has their own paths, so we may not feel resonant with what everyone does. The more accomplished a teacher is, the more their energy will feel resonant, and yet they may not be as easy to find. They are more likely to spend more time with their cultivation work, and less time in the temple greeting visitors, for example. 

All that is to example a few of the principles, as I understand them, that may be of service to you along your path. 

You are likely best served by finding yourself a Shang Qing teacher, if you want to receive and accomplish the Shang Qing methods and techniques. If you are able to work with 神 deities to accomplish your test, it may be important to know which ones to call upon in which way and so on. So being able to work from the text that was mentioned, along with the instructions of a teacher who has used its methods, may be necessary. 

If this is the right path for you, and if you are able to make solid progress with it, you will know. In general, we may find it easy to make progress with some things - up until we find ourselves navigating a blind spot. And then we may feel as though we hit a wall. So we need to figure out what to change in order to navigate past that obstruction. If we listen to the answers that show up, we may be able to find the way forward. If we can't get clarity on it, we may have to look for the answers harder, including from teachers. IMO the best teachers are the one's who we call for in our hearts. They may not always show up in the forms we expect, but their guidance tends to be true, when we learn how to listen to it. 

If you are on a path of working with 神 deities, then - as you've said - it may be the most helpful to listen to the guidance of the spiritual guides that come to you. Maybe you have developed the capacity to work with your guides already, maybe not. If not, the Secret of the Golden Flower may be helpful.

1k8yxi3,mpekbls,t3_1k8yxi3,Wildernaess,"So I had been percolating in Daoist shit for a bit over 20 years by now and found my way to a sort of soft perennialist pov on religion et al. But my academic training is in anthropology where context is everything and meaning arises or is plumbed and evolves contextually and often interdependently. Many times in my life I have come across sentiments and passages and so on that reflect Dao back at me. Sometimes they are more salient than this or that translation of DDJ or Zhuangzi.

Despite all that, I find myself disdaining lots of New Age/NAD stuff and takes and find a lot of it is performative and naively shallow -- most people dress in layers. That is, I understand your impulse. Maybe reading more context, they would become Better Daoists. But I don't think so. I think that would just be fingers pointing at fingers pointing at the moon.

The perennialist and what I identify as the Taoist in me (I miss it being ""Tao"", call me nostalgic) both find it a bit ironic that IMO you've conflated the Dao and Daoism. To understand a text as the author meant it -- DDJ and its historical context -- it is certainly true that going back to the source is important. I'm not sure it is strictly necessary to understand the mystery. It is important in all scholarship not to lose the forest for the trees, nor the reverse. To focus too much on determining orthodoxy, you risk fundamentalism. Systems thinking involves taking a step back and evaluating the context, but as Arne Naess says, ""The system begins with the immediate"" and I think there's a lot to that in relation to Dao.

You also said, ""The DDJ can be seen as posing an ultimate, possibly the ultimate, question, but the answers aren't inside the book. Being a Daoist means accepting the question and seeking the (unreachable) answer, including in adjacent works."" I agree with the first, but I would say that your use of ""Daoist"" remains nebulous and not well-specified. You've written a lot around the boundaries of what is or isn't proper Daoism; can you offer a clear definition?

Ultimately, in the sense that there are many paths up the mountain, even Daoism is just a way a seeing and it's only natural to forget that first line of DDJ in your own practice and study of it.

One of my favorite quotes about Taoism is from Tolbert McCarroll, who has a translation of DDJ and on paper sounds like exactly the kind of proto/boomer New Age Cali guy you picture -- from a community called Starcross, goes by Brother Michael, etc. He says in his preface: ""The Tao is universal.

Your post reads as very privileged and aggressive. I think it's great that you've had the opportunity to read all the sources and texts you're insisting others read. If I had the time to do nothing else, reading those texts and learning a new language is all I would do.

But a lot of people have 1-3 jobs, families, and the many daily difficulties needed to just survive. As a result many people in life don't even seek to better themselves and instead choose use their spare time on watching TV. The few who do seek betterment allot what little time they have to reading the TTJ, find it resonates with them, and try to align their life accordingly. They would love to read everything you suggested, but it's difficult to make time with the other responsibilities and expectations from their jobs, kids, and families.

And speaking as someone who just started a journey into Taoism, your post is very off putting. It feels like someone saying they are a fan of Lord of the Rings only to have someone tell them they can't call themselves a fan unless they have seen all the Peter Jackson movies (extended edition with commentary), the old animated movies, read the trilogy, read the Hobbit, read the Simarilion, and gained a full understanding of the life of Tolkien including an understanding of his WWI experiences and the political factors that led to WWI. It feels like swatting someone on the nose with a newspaper for having an interest in the Tao without having devoted their life to a Taoist monastery. 

You sound knowledgeable. And I'd honestly like to know where to take my journey when I finish what I'm currently reading. Might I suggest a post such as:

It's really great that so many people from the west are interested in Taoism. The cool thing with learning is that it has no end! Answers beget questions and the search for understanding the mystery of Tao is an exciting and neverending.

1k8yxi3,mq5q4ie,t3_1k8yxi3,Guileag,"What I find interesting about these arguments is that I don't disagree, because I'm an atheist who ultimately believes that the Dao is another man-made ideology, and that ideologies are deeply culture-bound (using 'culture' more loosely here than just ethnic).

From the more religious perspective where this is the simple reality of existence, it seems odd to me to believe that it could only ever be understood (and I assume practiced 'right') by people with scholarly knowledge of the deep cultural history of one particular people throughout history.

I appreciate you don't want to focus on the Dao De Jing, though I don't think you can cast it out either - and it makes the point many times over that the Dao is a universal and inescapable truth in all our lives, the Dao that can be named is not the Dao and those ignorant of the Dao find it more easily, effortless action, so on and so forth.

Maybe it depends on whether you're interested in the Dao as a universal concept that  happens to have been expressed to its fullest degree by a particular people and so has been heavily influenced by their culture, or whether you're interested in the Dao as a cultural ideology that has had huge significance within and beyond that culture.

To be clear I don't think the two can really be separated. Even if I'm studying a universal truth, I'm studying it through the perspective of a particular culture that has on top of that been translated into another language and cultural perspective. The more I know about the wider context - particularly if I can access it in the original language - the more context I have for where the 'truth' has been tinged by cultural or simply human influence.

I imagine it's the same with other religions. I don't think you can understand them without understanding the history, such as how and why the modern Christian bible has the specific scriptures it does and not others and how the Catholic Church came to hold so much power.

Respectfully, I just don't.

This might make me a philistine in your view, and that's OK too.

\> you should at least learn Classical Chinese

I have no interested in this.

Like, I understand there are probably insights and wisdom this functionally cuts me off from.

In the similar sense that studying organic chemistry much more deeply would give me insight into the world that can't be accessed without prerequisite knowledge.

Claiming that you're not serious about Daoism, after all, is perfectly reasonable; Daoism (in whatever particular form) is fundamentally a philosophical technology. Why do I say that? Because in China itself, Daoism is both triumphant and subjugated; it is employed by every ideological enterprise in China, even Marxism, while not being ideologically ascendant in its pure form. It's the religious Daoists who want to make Daoism something more, but people keep on pointing out the disconnect between creating Gods who receive worship and philosophical Daoism which is essentially atheist.

  
Honestly, I hadn't intended it as such, but it turned out into a inadvertent troll of sorts; I was expecting, based on posting in the other thread, that people were interested in picking up the rest of the Chinese tradition into which Daoism permeated, but here you even have people attacking Xuanxue (Neo-Daoism) as a separate tradition whereas the linkage between Xuanxue and Warring-States Daoism is that of roughly the same philosophy being reimplemented 500 years later.

  
And it's the attacks that are funny; it's like the jokes about Stoicism contests or trying to piss off Buddhist monks. The vehement and fanatical users are acting like religious Daoists without being part of a Daoist religion.

Yes, I disagree with that reading, too, though whenever I bring it up, it clearly upsets a lot of people. Also, when translators use the word ""Eternal"" with a higher case ""E"", they're imposing a lot of Western religious cultural baggage onto that word.

>""Some things I have unusual views on don't really matter like I think it's ""straw and dogs"" rather than ""straw dogs"", but the thrust is basically the same so no biggy.""

This is from Chapter 11 of the Huainanzi:-

>""Many of those who oversee affairs in the world depart from the source of the Way and its Potency, saying that Ritual and Rightness suffice to order the empire. One cannot discuss techniques with people like them. What is called “Ritual and Rightness” is the methods, statutes, ways, and customs of the Five Thearchs and the Three Kings. They are the remnants of a \[former\] age. Compare them to straw dogs and earthen dragons when they are first fashioned.

>They are patterned with green and yellow,

>wrapped with silk and embroidery,

>bound with vermilion silk,

>clothed in white and black garb.""

This might suggest that ""straw dogs"" is the correct translation, though 芻狗 can also be translated as ""Straw and Dogs"", so as you said, ""no biggy"".

>""I guess another big one is I think the DDJ is talking about Dao sure, but also sometimes the higher concept than Dao, which is merely styled Dao. Basically Xuan. I think the DDJ is about Xuan, however much Wang Bi got right or made up himself, that part I think is correct and that's unusual. (Xuan is also above Ming, and generally dao as the sort of cosmic force isn't really any more important than Ming as in I guess virtuous expressed truth?)""

Yeah, 玄學 seems to have been at the top of the hierarchy in Neo Daoism with Wang Bi, though based on my limited reading and understanding of Guo Xiang, he appears to have put ""Ziran"" 自然 at the top of the hierarchy because he staunchly rejected the metaphysical Dao and I don't recall him mentioning 玄學. For him, 自然 means that all phenomena arise ""spontaneously self-so"". This means Guo Xiang rejected a metaphysical Dao, and he also rejected cause and effect. (So the Buddhists can fuck off 🤣.)

Btw, I've only read a condensed version of the Guo Xiang commentary, so I'm happy to be corrected if I've misunderstood Guo Xiang based on my limited reading. I do plan to tackle the full commentary eventually, though it makes my head hurt, lol.

>

>""I also think yin and yang have basically nothing to do with these texts.""

Professor Paul Fischer has something interesting to say about this in his translation of the DDJ:-

>

>""Yin-Yang (陰陽): Qi, or physical energy, is often described as having two basic modalities, one active and one stable or receptive (the usual antonym to “active” is “passive,” but this carries an unfortunate negative connotation), that might be conceived as analogous to the positive and negative charges of electricity, though a better analogy might be the spectrum of temperature from hot to cold. Yin and Yang appear in the text only once, in chapter 42, but the dichotomy is implied in chapter 28 and, indeed, throughout the text. A Yin-Yang analytic is at work in cosmology, as the next key concept will show, and in anthropology, as the sixth key concept will show.

>But I think the most trenchant use of the Yin-Yang idea manifests in all of the key concepts for self-cultivation detailed here. For example, unlearning, introspection, non-contrivance, contentment are all certainly good bits of advice, but implicit in each of them is their opposite: after unlearning, there must be learning; after introspection, there must be action; non-contrivance is ideal for one’s personal life, but contrivance is necessary for one’s social and professional life; a certain degree of contentment is certainly necessary for happiness, but there are times when discontent will be crucial for beneficial change. In a world of clear Yang-specific norms and rules, there will be times—sometimes very decisive times, where fuzzy Yin contingency must contravene them. Recognising this truth, to me, is the genius of Yin-Yang thinking. (for the fifth and sixth key concepts check out the introduction to this translation in the downloadable PDF link below)""

A Refreshing and Rethinking Retrieval of Greek Thinking presents a rereading and rethinking of Greek philosophy in an attempt to retrieve an essential thread in Greek thinking that has been covered over for many centuries – beginning with the late Greeks, then Christianity, and then rationalism – and misrepresented by mistranslations from the seventeenth century onward. Using Heidegger’s work with Greek thinking as a springboard, the book shows how the covering over of this essential thread happened.


Kenneth Maly provides a frame by which those not trained in philosophy and phenomenology of experience can grasp the wider import of this rethinking of Greek philosophy. The book delves deep into key questions, preparing readers for extensive and more technical work with the key Greek words and their meanings, hidden for centuries. It includes a significant investigation of how this task requires a different way of language, how early Western thinking mirrors non-Western Daoism and Buddhism, and how quantum physics gets to the same place in its ""philosophy,"" with an emphasis on the work of David Bohm. In doing so, the book reveals how Daoism, Buddhism, the quantum potential of quantum physics, and Heidegger’s being-beyng are all mirrored in Greek philosophy, above all in early Greek thinking.",2,1745695870.0,0,exactly look cover similar territory description refreshing rethinking retrieval greek thinking present rereading rethinking greek philosophy attempt retrieve essential thread greek thinking cover century begin late greek christianity rationalism misrepresent mistranslation seventeenth century onward heidegger work greek thinking springboard book show covering essential thread happen kenneth maly provide frame train philosophy phenomenology experience grasp wide import rethinking greek philosophy book delve deep key question prepare reader extensive technical work key greek word meaning hide century include significant investigation task require different way language early western thinking mirror non western daoism buddhism quantum physics get place philosophy emphasis work david bohm book reveal daoism buddhism quantum potential quantum physics heidegger beyng mirror greek philosophy early greek thinking,-1,,,0.2869,,,positive

Now-a-days, when I read something it's not to learn something, it's to familiarize myself with the text. 

I now read things with a discerning eye. 

Remember, these kinds of writings are a finger pointing to the moon. They describe
what something is ""like"", not what it ""is"", with precision. 

So, for me, it's about, ""That was described, or pointed to, well!"", or, ""That could've been described more accurately, or more completely!"".

Most of the time i don't think things are completely wrong, just not as well described as it could be for modern minds.

One of the biases, many in the west bring to reading these works, is that these descriptions of Tao's processes, are ""inerrant scripture"", as opposed to one, or many, person's personal experience which is then described.

This is an artifact of Judaism, Christianity and Islam which insist their main books are the inerrant words of God. 

Many westerners tend to bring with them this bias, and commonly don't recognize they are doing so.

So, having said all of this, yes I would likely read some of this work, perhaps all of it, but no guarantees.

If it would go too far astray into incomplete description, or even if it were, ""Oh! Wow! Great Book!"" I might not read all of it.

This is like taking an artist's description of the scent of a rose, or a beautiful sunset, as the standard by which all other descriptions should be measured. 

This is incomplete understanding and description, because it is imposing a conformity to orthodoxy and a disregarding of Lao's Chapter One which cautions us against this very thing.

Realization and insight grows from the inside out through direct perception gained through practice and then understood through the doing and then practice describing to others. 

Learning from the outside occurs from reading and being taught by others. This form of learning encourages the conformity to an e[x]ternal standard.

Consider the difference in the description of how to surf from someone who has devoted themselves to surfing for 5 years, 20 years, 40 years and 60 years. 

There is more likely for there to be deep and meaningful insight from the ones with greater experience, over those with lesser experience, even if the longer practiced persons didn't take it as seriously as someone practicing for only 10 years. 

This is because experience means much more than we sometimes presume when we are beginning. 

This is something that has more direct meaning once we are old. 

This is also because we don't know what we don't know until we know it and this discovery occurs over time, not from solely from reading.

This does not mean beginners shouldn't write according to their experiences. 

When it comes to Tao, absolutely everything counts as practice. 

Writing our thoughts and experiences helps us and others and is also our practice. 

So, if this work is your own, kudos to you, good job, and keep up the good work!

1k7wpky,mp68jgh,t3_1k7wpky,261c9h38f,"If you're having existential crises from your studies then you would do well to study Pyrrhonism, Ajnana and Charvaka.

Pyrrhonism and Ajnana have the goal of suspending ALL positions to achieve mental peace, and Charvaka brings it back around to the logical necessity that one must at a minimum accept commonsense reality (or else you'd starve to death by denying that food exists lol!).

""\[The skeptic\] does not believe that \[his words\] are true; he does not believe that they are false; he does not even believe that they are true or false, that is, that they make sense. And in this attitude he finds ataraxia, a kind of intellectual peace of mind.""

\-Benson Mates, The Skeptic Way, Sextus Empiricus Outlines of Pyrrhonism  

""The causal principle of scepticism we say is the hope of attaining ataraxia (becoming tranquil). Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would attain ataraxia. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs.""

— Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I, Chapter 12

"" ""If you ask me whether there is a next world, then if it were to occur to me (iti ce me assa) that there is a next world, I would pronounce that there is a next world. Yet, I do not say so, I do not say thus, I do not say otherwise, I do not say no, I deny the denials. Similarly with regard to the propositions.""

\-Digha Nikaya 1

Note: even the Pyrrhonists, especially modern ones on reddit and such, frequently end up taking some position or other. But, considering the usefulness of skepticism aimed at being without position, I take the above quotes as perfect solutions to these positions.

Apply them, for example, to the modern Pyrrhonist's frequent stubborn holding of relativism as a position. Though they will play word games to deny it as a position, they also will vehemently refuse to even consider that relativism might not be true, or Pyrrho forbid, that extreme relativism is incoherent.

The real goal, as I understand it, is mental peace through truly being without position. Thus, the way I read Pyrrhonist texts is that ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING in them is subject to being let go of. They are just tools, not positions, and to take them as positions is to completely misunderstand the goal of Pyrrhonism. Even if it is to embrace the exact words of some famous Pyrrhonists, it is to fail to reach ataraxia properly.

We need to be able to say, ""Your position is fallible because it can be shown as relative, and not absolutely true"" and then, just as easily say, ""The position of relativism can also be considered fallible, and so we may drop this nonsense and have lunch."" In other words, ataraxia.

Once you have this technique down, you are ready to study again safely, as you will have learned how to drop things and avoid anxiety about them. There is also much in the Chuang Tzu about being empty minded, useless, and so on that agree with at least some degree of this ataraxia goal.

1k7wpky,mp5loju,t3_1k7wpky,az4th,"> 1.What skills transcend materialism? What truths does aging unveil,especially about health, helplessness, or the quiet wisdom youth often ignores?

Before the big bang, there was undifferentiated energy. Do we call it nothing? Can it be called something, if it has no form? Formless, yet poignant. 

Then in a moment of clarity, something is distinguished from the - we may now call it - nothing. In a flash of light, there is a big bang and energy (yang, heaven), spreads out throughout this formlessness (yin, earth), throughout all the realm. 

As yang and yin mix and merge and differentiate, within these mixings parameters of what is possible unfold. We call these the four forces:


    ⚎ Minor Yang (Wood) A light and buoyant force.  
    ⚌ Major Yang (Fire) A strong force.  
    ⚍ Minor Yin (Metal) A heavy force.  
    ⚏ Major Yin (Water) An abiding force.  

And the eight trigrams, that come together as pairs of the four forces with a poignant middle:


    ☰ Qian and ☷ Kun determine the positions.  
    ☱ Marshlands and ☶ Mountains circulate qi.  
    ☳ Thunder and ☴ Wind mutually entangle.  
    ☵ Water and ☲ Fire discharge in mutual opposition.  

Thus the framework of reality becomes established, and the myriad phenomena become created in endless possibilities.

And too, there is a way, that ever reveals to us the path back to our original root in our formless source that is everything and nothing all at once. 

Within form, we discover limitations, discover division, and discover that when one part moves, all parts move. And thus we are bound. Bound to a destiny to follow the path back to formlessness, or bound to become more deeply entangled within form.

This is our free will - this is our choice. 

Our spiritual curriculum, is to unravel this binding to become complete once again. Undivided and returned to being whole. Gathered as one with heavenly light again, purely yang, so that we can steep that wholeness within the emptiness and return to the undifferentiated state. 

But to put it this way makes it feel so out of reach. It is not. It does not come from attaching to the lofty distant possibility, but from centering oneself in what is right in front of one and surrendering to simply be and follow the way where it leads. 

The course is a meandering one - it spirals - ever true, yet ever mysterious. We find it with the clarity in our heart that aligns us with our upright posture to open us to divine light from the tops of our heads. This leads to returning the conditioning of the mind to its pure state that is free of thoughts that get in the way of the divine light flowing through us, reconnecting us to source. They call this Christ Consciousness, as well as Buddha Mind, and the Mind of Dao. It is reconnection with our true self.

The way leads us all differently, as each part within the whole is unique. It is each part's destiny to return. And, despite our differences, we are all one. And the more of us begin to walk this path, the more synchronistic flows we discover that merge us all back into a great harmony. A harmony that becomes less and less divided, and more and more effortlessly leading to what is whole. 

And so we follow this way naturally. It may take many lifetimes, each one learning the lessons we are ready for as we follow. Each one, becoming more and more naturally fulfilled in the way the ego always wants us to be - if only it could find the way to get out of its own way. Thus it is simple. 

> 2.Is chakra awakening a viable path? Where to begin without dogma? How about occult learnings? 

Many paths are viable. We pick up tools for their usefulness. And then put them down again when they are not necessary. 

Can we open ourselves energetically, while simultaneously being contained energetically, with no leaks? Can we heal our traumas, eliminate the conditioning of our habit momentum, and raise the vibration of our minds? Can we come to root between heaven and earth so that we are a vessel that allows these two to spontaneously circulate within us to naturally resolve all divisions, without getting in the way? 

Nothing more is needed than this. And, we all find our way to this by stepping forward along our paths and listening to what we need to help us - listening to what tool is right for us, right now. Asking ourselves what we need to do to create more inner clarity and resolve past divisions within our bodies, our hearts, and our minds.

> 3.To those who’ve navigated similar storms, what would you tell your younger self? What milestones (spiritual or worldly) matter a lot by 30 or 40?

The celestial mechanism of change is ever churning. We go through periods of difficulty. And they are tests to see if we can avoid extremes and hold to our centers. Tests for us to let go of inner division to find greater clarity, rather than clinging to the attachments of illusion. 

All of the bindings of attachment are simply holding us away from unity. In re-leasing those attachments, in forgiving our attachment to them, whatever they may be, we re-lease the energy between us and them that is holding us apart from becoming unified as one with them again. 

Thus, all wrongness, judgment, separation and division is but illusion. 

Just as all matter is simply vibration of energy. 

In raising our vibration, we become more and more refined and able to tune into the nature of this. Until we can eventually form and unform our bodies at will. But such things happen of themselves, as needed. Powers exist, and powers cannot be attached to, or we soon lose them. Maintaining our cultivation ever depends upon being empty of that which could prevent it from flowing through. 

> 4.'Books': My Goodreads list overflows,where to start? (Drop profiles if you’re there!) A wise man told me to read biographies first. 

*Opening the Dragon Gate*

*The Tao of Health, Longevity, and Immortality*

*The Uncharted Voyage Toward the Subtle Light*

All religion leads to the same ultimate spiritual accomplishments. It is just their dogma that creates division. When we discover how to see through to their deepest truths, we get past all that which exists in division. 

A mountain top may have many paths leading up to its summit. By nature, they are all different ways. Being different, they may all contend with each other, because they are different. But so long as we can see them all as serving the right purpose for the right people, and learn that each part must follow its own path, we become immune from judging others as right or wrong. 

Principles are useful, because they are not fixed and rigid, but are malleable. 

And ultimately at their hearts they connect back to unity. 

First there is rule by law. 

Then there is rule by principle. 

The the rule of the way can naturally come into existence. 

Nature established this with the subtle balances in ecosystems that allowed ever more forms of life to co-exist. With many checks and balances, every species depended upon fitting into that balance in order to survive. This dependency cohered to spiritual development. This is why the animals, plants and trees of nature are so sensitive. They are connecting with the light and not blocking it with their minds. 

Human nature was once like this too. And yet in coming to dominate the food chain, it became divided from the demands of nature, and humanity enabled itself to fall victim to unchecked desire and greed. Such things ever discover balance yet again. But with that balance arrive as it does for a host that falls victim to its cancer? Or as the cancer that surrenders its greed to realign with the balanced way again?

One way or another, what is unsustainable, cannot sustain. 

Thus the *dao de jing* tells us:

Humans have been farming for thousands of years and in the process depleting the soil and causing desertification. Our destruction of the environment has sped up with the industrial revolution but we were well on our way before that. 

And at this point we are well beyond the carrying capacity of the earth if we were to return to a hunter gather way of life. Farming increases the caloric output you can expect from a given piece of land. 

So do we return to natural farming? 

But we can’t even do that, we can’t farm at the levels we need without manufactured fertilizer to replenish the nitrogen in the soil. Fritz Haber made that possible by developing a method for pulling nitrogen from the atmosphere. This has made it possible to feel billions.

[ side note cause it just blows my mind: He also developed Zyclon, the pesticide that would be altered into Zyclon B and used in the Holocaust to kill people in the gas chambers. He was also Jewish.

…His work saved billions and killed millions… we can’t control how the things we learn are used by others.]

Because of his work there is no going back without the death of billions first. 

Is it not natural for life to grow, adapt and change? If things are unbalanced then we must seek for balance, but it will necessarily be a new balancing of forces because of the long history that has carried us to this moment and altered the very forces themselves.

How can we temper our knowledge with wisdom? 

Is it not natural to want to help others, to protect others? We will do anything to protect those we love. 

We can go back but at what cost? Is it in harmony with our nature to accept that loss of human life?

Is perhaps the unnatural thing not our innovation and inquiry, but our corporate greed? Our valuation of GDP over human lives? Our reduction of a human soul to a monetary value?

1k6swy4,mouijmk,t1_mot3ko7,Maximilian-Pegasus,"Yeah when I read it all again, I can't pinpoint exactly what I have meant by returning to the natural way. Natural is very hard to define, and it is one one of the most common sources of fallacies.

For farming, it was more local and more of a closed circle before the industrialization of farming. Farmers would produce crops, feed them to livestock, and then put their manure back in the same fields they got the animal feed from. We weren't really destroying the environment in the same way that we do now. Nowadays, you farm land in Europe, export the products to North America, and get your fertilizer from phosphates found in North Africa. In this crazy globalized process, a great dis-balance is created. 

And in your sidenote about Fritz Haber, that is exactly what I fear. We cannot control what our inventions are going to be used for, same goes for the people that were involved in nuclear energy research, who were doing it to benefit humanity, and then some other folks used their research to create the most destructive weapon in history that could easily wipe out all living things from the face of the Earth. Then again, the nuclear bomb actually brought relative world peace between great powers, which reminds me of the story of the farmer, we should not be quick to judge things :)

That's a great point about corporate greed and greed in general, I think chasing the GDP numbers and being in a constant process of increasing it is one of the worst things happening to us right now, but then again, isn't all this ""natural"" too.

You’re taking a somewhat biased stance based on your personal interpretation of Daoism and also your own experiences.

However, the picture may be experienced either incrementally ""or"" all at once. 

With the incremental view the mind of the experiencer interacts with the picture as similar to an ant crawling across the picture, that is, from a narrower perspective wherein only so much of the picture may be observed at a time due to the ant's narrower perspective.

While from above, an observer of the picture perceives the entirety of the experience all at once.

In this manner the ant experiences the picture in a more linear fashion than an observer who perceives from above who perceives the picture holistically, rather than incrementally.
